"Sec 21 (a) (1) The Congress finds that adequate records maintained by insured banks have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings. The Congress further finds that microfilm or other reproductions and other records made by banks of checks, as well as records kept by banks of the identity of persons maintaining or authorized to act with respect to accounts therein, have been of particular value in this respect.

"(2) It is the purpose of this section to require the maintenance of 
appropriate types of records by insured banks in the United States 
where such records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, 
or regulatory investigations or proceedings.
"(b) Where the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this sec- 
tion as the 'Secretary') determines that the maintenance of appropriate
types of records and other evidence by insured banks has a high degree 
of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or pro-
ceedings, he shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes 
of this section.
"(c) Each insured bank shall maintain such records and other evi- 
dence, in such form as the Secretary shall require, of the identity of 
each person having an account in the United States with the bank 
and of each individual authorized to sign checks, make withdrawals,
or otherwise act with respect to any such account. The Secretary may 
make such exemptions from any requirement otherwise imposed under
this subsection as are consistent with the purposes of this section.
"(d) Each insured bank shall make, to the extent that the regula- 
tions of the Secretary so require—
"(1) a microfilm or other reproduction of each check, draft, or
similar instrument drawn on it and presented to it for payment; 
                 and
"(2) a record of each check, draft, or similar instrument
     received by it for deposit or collection, together with an identifi-
     cation of the party for whose account it is to be deposited or col- 
     lected, unless the bank has already made a record of the party's
     identity pursuant to subsection (c).
"(e) Whenever any individual engages (whether as principal, agent, 
or bailee) in any transaction with an insured bank which is required
to be reported or recorded under the Currency and Foreign Transac- 
tions Reporting Act, the bank shall require and retain such evidence 
of the identity of that individual as the Secretary may prescribe as 
appropriate under the circumstances.
"(f) In addition to or in lieu of the records and evidence otherwise 
referred to in this section, each insured bank shall maintain such 
records and evidence as the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the 
purposes of this section.
"(g) Any type of record or evidence required under this section
shall be retained for such period as the Secretary may prescribe for
the type in question. Any period so prescribed shall not exceed six 
years unless the Secretary determines, having regard for the purposes
of this section, that a longer period is necessary in the case of a partic- 
ular type of record or evidence.
"(h) The Secretary shall include in his annual report to the Con- 
gress information on his implementation of the authority conferred 
by this section and any similar authority with respect to recordkeeping
or reporting requirements conferred by other provisions of law."

§ 121. Congressional findings and purpose

nesses engaged in the functions described in section 123 (b) of this Act

    (b) It is the purpose of this chapter to require the maintenance of
appropriate types of records and the making of appropriate reports
by such businesses in the United States when such records or reports
have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory in-

    Where the Secretary determines that the making of appropriate
reports by uninsured banks or uninsured institutions of any type with
respect to their ownership, control, and managements and any changes

or institutions to make such reports as he determines in respect of
such ownership, control, and managements and changes therein.

§ 123. Authority of Secretary with respect to recordkeeping and procedures
    (a) Where the Secretary determines that the maintenance of
appropriate records and procedures by any uninsured bank or unin-
sured institution, or any person engaging in the business of carrying
on in the United States any of the functions referred to in subsection
(b) of this section, has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax,
or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he may by regulation
require such bank, institution, or person-

retain, or maintain; and

ments imposed under this chapter. For the purposes of any civil
or criminal penalty, a separate violation of any requirement
under this paragraph occurs with respect to each day and each

occurs or continues.
(b) The authority of the Secretary under this section extends to any
person engaging in the business of carrying on any of the following

checks, or similar instruments, except as an incident to the con-
duct of its own nonfinancial business.

internationally.

Secretary in regulations.

§ 124. Injunctions
Whenever it appears to the Secretary that any person has engaged,
is engaged, or is about to engage in any acts or practices constituting a
violation of any regulation under this chapter, he may in his discretion 
bring an action, in the proper district court of the United States or the
proper United States court of any territory or other place subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such acts or practices,
and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or
restraining order shall be granted without bond. Upon application of
the Secretary, any such court may also issue mandatory injunctions
commanding any person to comply with any regulation of the Secre-
tary under this chapter.

§ 125. Civil penalties.
(a) For each willful violation of any regulation under this chapter,
the Secretary may assess upon any person to which the regulation

willfully participates in the violation, a civil penalty not exceeding

          "(a) The Congress makes the following findings:
          "(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate 
        credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the ef-
        ficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods
        undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued
        functioning of the banking system.
          "(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating
        and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity,
        character, and general reputation of consumers.

        assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on
        CoIlSlUners.
          "(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies
        exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and
        a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.
          "(b) It is the purpose of this title to require that consumer report-
        ing agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of
        commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other in-
        formation in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,
        with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper

        of this title.

        mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in
        whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing
        the consumer's eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used pri-
        marily for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) employ-
        ment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under section 604.
        The term does not include (A) any report containing information
        solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and
        the person making the report; (B) any authorization or approval of
        a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of
        a credit card or similar device; or (C) any report in which a person
        who has been requested by a third party to make a specific extension
        of credit directly or indirectly to a consumer conveys his decision
        with respect to such request, if the third party advises the consumer
        of the name and address of the person to whom the request was made
        and such person makes the disclosures to the consumer required under
        section 615.

        report or portion thereof in which information on a consumer's

agency.
                                                                    
"§ 609. Disclosures to consumers
    "(a) Every consumer reporting agency shall, upon request and
proper identification of any consumer, clearly and accurately disclose
to the consumer:
        "(1) The nature and substance of all information (except medical
    information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.
        "(2) The sources of the information; except that the sources of
   information acquired solely for use in preparing an investigative con-
   sumer report and actually used for no other purpose need not be dis-
   closed: Provided, That in the event an action is brought under this
   title, such sources shall be available to the plaintiff under appropriate
   discovery procedures in the court in which the action is brought.
        "(3) The recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which
    it has furnished-
        "(A) for employment purposes within the two-year period
     preceding the request, and
        "(B) for any other purpose within the six-month period pre-
    ceding the request.
    "(b) The requirements of subsection (a) respecting the disclosure
of sources of information and the recipients of consumer reports do
not apply to information received or consumer reports furnished prior
to the effective date of this title except to the extent that the matter
involved is contained in the files of the consumer reporting agency on
that date.
  
"§ 610. Conditions of disclosure to consumers
    "(a) A consumer reporting agency shall make the disclosures
required under section 609 during normal business hours and on
reasonable notice.
    "(b) The disclosures required under section 609 shall be made to the
consumer-
        "(1) in person if he appears in person and furnishes proper
    identification; or
        "(2) by telephone if he has made a written request, with
    proper identification, for telephone disclosure and the toll charge,

nel to explain to the consumer any information furnished to him pur-
suant to section 609.

tion. A consumer reporting agency may require the consumer to fur-
nish a written statement granting permission to the consumer
reporting agency to discuss the consumer's file in such person’s
presence.
    "(e) Except as provided in sections 616 and 617, no consumer may
bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation, invasion of
privacy, or negligence with respect to the reporting of information
against any consumer reporting agency, any user of information, or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency, based on information disclosed pursuant to section 609, 610, or 615, except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.

"§ 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy

"(a) If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in his file is disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is directly conveyed to the consumer reporting agency by the consumer, the consumer reporting agency shall within a reasonable period of time reinvestigate and record the current status of that information unless it has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant. If after such reinvestigation such information is found to be inaccurate or can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall promptly delete such information. The presence of contradictory information in the consumer’s file does not in and of itself constitute reasonable grounds for believing the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.

"(b) If the reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumer may file a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute. The consumer reporting agency may limit such statements to not more than one hundred words if it provides the consumer with assistance in writing a clear summary of the dispute.

"(c) Whenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there is reasonable grounds to believe that it is frivolous or irrelevant, the consumer reporting agency shall, in any subsequent consumer report containing the information in question, clearly note that it is disputed by the consumer and provide either the consumer’s statement or a clear and accurate codification or summary thereof.

"(d) Following any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified or any notation as to disputed information, the consumer reporting agency shall, at the request of the consumer, furnish notification that the item has been deleted or the statement, codification or summary pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) to any person specifically designated by the consumer who has within two years prior thereto received a consumer report for employment purposes, or within six months prior thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose, which contained the deleted or disputed information. The consumer reporting agency shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the consumer his rights to make such a request. Such disclosure shall be made at or prior to the time the information is deleted or the consumer’s statement regarding the disputed information is received.

"§ 612. Charges for certain disclosures

"A consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 609 and furnish all consumer reports pursuant to section 611(d) without charge to the consumer if, within thirty days after receipt by such consumer of a notification pursuant to section 615 or notification from a debt collection agency affiliated with such consumer reporting agency stating that the consumer’s credit rating may be or has been adversely affected, the consumer makes a request under section 609 or 611(d). Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge on the consumer for making disclosure to such consumer pursuant to section 609, the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to making disclosure; and for furnishing notifications, statements, summaries, or codifications to person designated by the consumer pursuant to section 611(d), the charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to furnish

ing such information and shall not exceed the charge that the consumer reporting agency would impose on each designated recipient for a consumer report except that no charge may be made for notifying such persons of the deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or which can no longer be verified.

"§ 613. Public record information for employment purposes
"A consumer reporting agency which furnishes a consumer report for employment purposes and which for that purpose compiles and reports items of information on consumers which are matters of public record and are likely to have an adverse effect upon a consumer's ability to obtain employment shall-
        "(1) at the time such public record information is reported to the user of such consumer report, notify the consumer of the fact that public record information is being reported by the consumer reporting agency, together with the name and address of the person to whom such information is being reported; or
        "(2) maintain strict procedures designed to insure that whenever public record information which is likely to have an adverse effect on a consumer's ability to obtain employment is reported it is complete and up to date. For purposes of this paragraph, items of public record relating to arrests, indictments, convictions, suits, tax liens, and outstanding judgments shall be considered up to date if the current public record status of the item at the time of the report is reported.

"§ 614. Restrictions on investigative consumer reports
"Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares an investigative consumer report, no adverse information in the consumer report (other than information which is a matter of public record) may be included in a subsequent consumer report unless such adverse information has been verified in the process of making such subsequent consumer report, or the adverse information was received within the three-month period preceeding the date the subsequent report is furnished.

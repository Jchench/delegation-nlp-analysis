    (a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Secretary”) shall
conduct a study of home and builder’s warranties and protection
plans regarding the construction of, and materials used in, 1- to
4-family dwellings subject to mortgages insured under title II of
the National Housing Act.
    (b) SCOPE OF STUDY.—The study shall analyze—
        (1) the extent to which home sellers and builders use
             such warranties and plans,
        (2) how such warranties and plans affect the single family
             mortgage insurance program under the National Housing Act
             and the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund,
        (3) any effects on homeowners of reliance upon such
             warranties and plans,
        (4) the cost of inspections of mortgaged homes not covered
             by such warranties or plans,
        (5) how quickly the issuers of such warranties and plans
             pay claims to homeowners under the warranties and plans,
        (6) how well such warranties and plans provide for the
             prevention of structural damage before damage occurs,
        (7) how responsive the issuers are to homeowner
             complaints,
        (8) the extent to which homeowners are adequately
             informed of the extent of insurance coverage, the complaint
             procedures, and the arbitration procedures available to them
             under such warranties and plans,
        (9) the extent to which the arbitration process used to
             settle claims under such warranties and plans provides fair
             and reasonable relief for homeowners,
        (10) how well homeowners are informed of their right to
              appeal the decision of such arbitrators to the Secretary,
        (11) whether the reporting and inspection requirements
              to which such warranties and plans are subject provide the
              Secretary with sufficient information to verify that such
              warranties and plans are acceptable,
        (12) whether dwellings covered by such warranties and
              plans satisfy all requirements which would have been applicable
              if such dwellings had been approved for mortgage insurance
              by the Secretary before the beginning of construction, and
        (13) any other issues relating to such warranties and plans
              that the Secretary considers appropriate.
    (c) REPORT.—The Secretary shall submit a report to the Con-
gress regarding the findings of the study and any recommendations
of the Secretary resulting from the study, not later than the expira-

(1) in the past half decade, there have been major legislative and administrative changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws and substantial improvements in the Nation's understanding of discrimination in the housing markets;

(2) in response to evidence of continuing housing discrimination, the Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, to provide for more effective enforcement of fair housing rights through judicial and administrative avenues and to expand the number of protected classes covered under Federal fair housing laws;
PUBLIC LAW 102-550—OCT. 28, 1992 106 STAT. 3869

(3) in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, the Congress expanded the disclosure provisions under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to provide increased information on the mortgage lending patterns of financial institutions; 
(4) in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Congress provided a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities; 
(5) in 1991, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act disclosed evidence of pervasive discrimination in the Nation’s mortgage lending markets; 
(6) the Housing Discrimination Survey, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, found that Hispanic and African-American homeseekers experience some form of discrimination in at least half of their encounters with sales and rental agents; 
(7) the Fair Housing Initiatives Program should be revised and expanded to reflect the significant changes in the fair housing and fair lending area that have taken place since the Program’s initial authorization in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987; 
(8) continuing educational efforts by the real estate industry are a useful way to increase understanding by the public of their fair housing rights and responsibilities; and

TITLE X—RESIDENTIAL LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARD REDUCTION ACT OF 1992

SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE.

This title may be cited as the "Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992".

SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds that—

(1) low-level lead poisoning is widespread among American children, afflicting as many as 3,000,000 children under age 6, with minority and low-income communities disproportionately affected;

(2) at low levels, lead poisoning in children causes intelligence quotient deficiencies, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, and behavior problems;

(3) pre-1980 American housing stock contains more than 3,000,000 tons of lead in the form of lead-based paint, with the vast majority of homes built before 1950 containing substantial amounts of lead-based paint;

(4) the ingestion of household dust containing lead from deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint is the most common cause of lead poisoning in children;

(5) the health and development of children living in as many as 3,800,000 American homes is endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-contaminated dust in their homes;

(6) the danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be reduced by abating lead-based paint or by taking interim measures to prevent paint deterioration and limit children's exposure to lead dust and chips;

(7) despite the enactment of laws in the early 1970's requiring the Federal Government to eliminate as far as practicable lead-based paint hazards in federally owned, assisted, and insured housing, the Federal response to this national crisis remains severely limited; and

(8) the Federal Government must take a leadership role in building the infrastructure—including an informed public, State and local delivery systems, certified inspectors, contractors, and laboratories, trained workers, and available financing and insurance—necessary to ensure that the national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing can be achieved as expeditiously as possible.

SEC. 1003. PURPOSES.

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible;

42 USC 4851b.         (2) to reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation's housing stock;
                            (3) to encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care;
                            (4) to ensure that the existence of lead-based paint hazards is taken into account in the development of Government housing policies and in the sale, rental, and renovation of homes and apartments;
                           (5) to mobilize national resources expeditiously, through a partnership among all levels of government and the private sector, to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards;
                           (6) to reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing owned, assisted, or transferred by the Federal Government; and
                           (7) to educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead-based paint poisoning and steps to reduce and eliminate such hazards.

SEC. 1301. SHORT TITLE.
     This title may be cited as the "Federal Housing Enterprises
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992". 

SEC. 1302. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.
     The Congress finds that--
     (1) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the 
     Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (referred to in this
     section collectively as the "enterprises"), and the Federal Home
     Loan Banks (referred to in this section as the "Banks"), have
     important public missions that are reflected in the statutes
     and charter Acts establishing the Banks and the enterprises;
     (2) because the continued ability of the Federal National
     Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
     Corporation to accomplish their public missions is important
     to providing housing in the United States and the health of
     the Nation's economy, more effective Federal regulation is
     needed to reduce the risk of failure of the enterprises;
     (3) considering the current operating procedures of the
     Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan
     Mortgage Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Banks,
     the enterprises and the Banks currently pose low financial
     risk of insolvency;
     (4) neither the enterprises nor the Banks, nor any securities
     or obligations issued by the enterprises or the Banks, are
     backed by the full faith and credit of the United States;
     (5) an entity regulating the Federal National Mortgage
     Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
     should have sufficient autonomy from the enterprises and spe-
     cial interest groups;
     (6) an entity regulating such enterprises should have the
     authority to establish capital standards, require financial disclo-
     sure, prescribe adequate standards for books and records and
     other internal controls, conduct examinations when necessary,
PUBLIC LAW 102-550—OCT. 28, 1992
106 STAT. 3942

and enforce compliance with the standards and rules that it establishes;

(7) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return;

(8) the Federal Home Loan Bank Act should be amended to emphasize that providing for financial safety and soundness of the Federal Home Loan Banks is the primary mission of the Federal Housing Finance Board.

Subtitle B—Required Capital Levels for Enterprises and Special Enforcement Powers

    SEC. 1361. RISK-BASED CAPITAL LEVELS.
    (a) RISK-BASED CAPITAL TEST.—The Director shall, by regula-
tion, establish a risk-based capital test under this section for the
enterprises. When applied to an enterprise, the risk-based capital
test shall determine the amount of total capital for the enterprise
that is sufficient for the enterprise to maintain positive capital
during a 10-year period in which the following circumstances occur
(in this section referred to as the "stress period"):

    (1) CREDIT RISK.—With respect to mortgages owned or
guaranteed by the enterprise and other obligations of the enter-
prise, losses occur throughout the United States at a rate
of default and severity (based on any measurements of default
reasonably related to prevailing practice for that industry in
determining capital adequacy) reasonably related to the rate
and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United
States containing an aggregate of not less than 5 percent of
the total population of the United States that, for a period
of not less than 2 years, experienced the highest rates of default
and severity of mortgage losses, in comparison with such rates
of default and severity of mortgage losses in other such areas
for any period of such duration.

    (2) INTEREST RATE RISK.—
    
        (A) IN GENERAL.—Interest rates decrease as described
in subparagraph (B) or increase as described in subpara-
graph (C), whichever would require more capital for the
enterprise.

        (B) DECREASES.—The 10-year constant maturity Treas-
ury yield decreases during the first year of the stress
period and will remain at the new level for the remainder
of the stress period. The yield decreases to the lesser of—

            (i) 600 basis points below the average yield during
the preceding 9 months, or
            
            (ii) 60 percent of the average yield during the
preceding 3 years,
            
but in no case to a yield less than 50 percent of the
average yield during the preceding 9 months.

        (C) INCREASES.—The 10-year constant maturity Treas-
ury yield increases during the first year of the stress period
and will remain at the new level for the remainder of
the stress period. The yield increases to the greater of—
        
            (i) 600 basis points above the average yield during
the preceding 9 months, or
            
            (ii) 160 percent of the average yield during the
preceding 3 years,
            
but in no case to a yield greater than 175 percent of
the average yield during the preceding 9 months.

        (D) DIFFERENT TERMS TO MATURITY.—Yields of Treas-
ury instruments with other terms to maturity will change
relative to the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield
in patterns and for durations that are reasonably related
PUBLIC LAW 102-550—OCT. 28, 1992      106 STAT. 3973

to historical experience and are judged reasonable by the Director.

(E) LARGE INCREASES IN YIELDS.—If the 10-year con­stant maturity Treasury yield is assumed to increase by more than 50 percent over the average yield during the preceding 9 months, the Director shall adjust the losses in paragraphs (1) and (3) to reflect a correspondingly higher rate of general price inflation. 

(3) NEW BUSINESS.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Any contractual commitments of the enterprise to purchase mortgages or issue securities will be fulfilled. The characteristics of resulting mortgage pur­chases, securities issued, and other financing will be consistent with the contractual terms of such commitments, recent experience, and the economic characteristics of the stress period. No other purchases of mortgages shall be assumed, except as provided in subparagraph (B).
(B) ADDITIONAL NEW BUSINESS.—The Director may, after consideration of each of the studies required by subparagraph (C), assume that the enterprise conducts additional new business during the stress period consistent with the following— 
(i) AMOUNT AND PRODUCT TYPES.—The amount and types of mortgages purchased and their financing will be reasonably related to recent experience and the economic characteristics of the stress period.
(ii) LOSSES.—Default and loss severity characteris­ tics of mortgages purchased will be reasonably related to historical experience.
(iii) PRICING.—Prices charged by the enterprise in purchasing new mortgages will be reasonably related to recent experience and the economic characteristics of the stress period. The Director may assume that a reasonable period of time would lapse before the enterprise would recognize and react to the characteris­ tics of the stress period.
(iv) INTEREST RATE RISK.—Interest rate risk on new mortgages purchased will occur to an extent reasonably related to historical experience.
(v) RESERVES.—The enterprise must maintain reserves during and at the end of the stress period on new business conducted during the first 5 years of the stress period reasonably related to the expected future losses on such business, consistent with gen­erally accepted accounting principles and industry accounting practice.
          
(C) STUDIES.—Within 1 year after regulations are first issued under subsection (e), the Director of the Congres­sional Budget Office, and the Comptroller General of the United States shall each submit to the Committee on Bank­ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a study of the advisability and appropriate form of any new business assumptions under subparagraph (B).
106 STAT. 3974	                                                  PUBLIC LAW 102-550—OCT. 28, 1992

(D) EFFECTIVE DATE—The provisions of subparagraph (B) shall become effective 4 years after regulations are first issued under subsection (e).
(4) OTHER ACTIVITIES—Losses or gains on other activities, including interest rate and foreign exchange hedging activities, shall be determined by the Director, on the basis of available information, to be consistent with the stress period.
(b) CONSIDERATIONS.—
(1) IN GENERAL—In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection (a), the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions among types of mortgage products, differences in seasoning of mortgages, and any other factors the Director considers appropriate.
(2) CONSISTENCY—Characteristics of the stress period other than those specifically set forth in subsection (a), such as prepayment experience and dividend policies, will be those determined by the Director, on the basis of available information, to be most consistent with the stress period.
(c) RISK-BASED CAPITAL LEVEL—For purposes of this subtitle, the risk-based capital level for an enterprise shall be equal to the sum of the following amounts:
(1) CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK—The amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the enterprise.
(2) MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS RISK—To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the enterprise.
(d) DEFINITIONS—For purposes of this section:
(1) SEASONING—The term “seasoning” means the change over time in the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of a mortgage to the value of the property by which such mortgage loan is secured, determined on an annual basis by region, in accordance with the Constant Quality Home Price Index published by the Secretary of Commerce (or any index of similar quality, authority, and public availability that is regularly used by the Federal Government).
(2) TYPE OF MORTGAGE PRODUCT—The term “type of mortgage product” means a classification of one or more mortgage products, as established by the Director, which have similar characteristics from each set of characteristics under the following subparagraphs:
(A) The property securing the mortgage is—
(i) a residential property consisting of 1 to 4 dwelling units; or 
(ii) a residential property consisting of more than 4 dwelling units. 
(B) The interest rate on the mortgage is—
(i) fixed; or 
(ii) adjustable. 
(C) The priority of the lien securing the mortgage is—
(i) first; or 
(ii) second or other. 
(D) The term of the mortgage is—
(i) 1 to 15 years; 
(ii) 16 to 30 years; or
PUBLIC LAW 102-550 - OCT. 28, 1992      106 STAT. 3975

(iii) more than 30 years.
(E) The owner of the property is—
(i) an owner-occupant; or
(ii) an investor.
(F) The unpaid principal balance of the mortgage—
(i) will amortize completely over the term of the
mortgage and will not increase significantly at any
time during the term of the mortgage;
(ii) will not amortize completely over the term
of the mortgage and will not increase significantly
at any time during the term of the mortgage; or
(iii) may increase significantly at some time during
the term of the mortgage.
(G) Any other characteristics of the mortgage, as the
Director may determine.

(e) REGULATIONS.-
(1) ISSUANCE.-The Director shall issue final regulations
establishing the risk-based capital test under this section not
later than the expiration of the 18-month period beginning

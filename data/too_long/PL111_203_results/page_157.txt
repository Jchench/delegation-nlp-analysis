(i) an employee transferred from the Office of Thrift Supervision holding a permanent position on the day before the transfer date; and
(ii) an employee of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation holding a permanent position on the day before the transfer date.
(2) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (1) does not limit the right of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation to—
(A) separate an employee for cause or for unacceptable performance;
(B) terminate an appointment to a position excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating character; or
(C) reassign an employee outside such employee’s locality pay area when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation determines that the reassignment is necessary for the efficient operation of the agency.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the employee was receiving a higher rate of basic pay on a temporary basis (because of a temporary assignment, temporary promotion, or other temporary action) immediately before the transfer, the Agency may reduce the rate of basic pay on the date the rate would have been reduced but for the transfer, and the protected rate for the remainder of the 30-month period will be the reduced rate that would have applied but for the transfer.

(A) for cause, including for unacceptable performance; or
(B) with the consent of the transferred employee.
(3) PROTECTION ONLY WHILE EMPLOYED.—This subsection shall apply to a transferred employee only during the period that the transferred employee remains employed by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Corporation.

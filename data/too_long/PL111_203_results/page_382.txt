124 STAT. 1756             PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 

“(II) whose outstanding security-based swaps 
 create substantial counterparty exposure that could 
 have serious adverse effects on the financial stability 
 of the United States banking system or financial mar- 
 kets; or 
 “(III) that is a financial entity that— 
 “(aa) is highly leveraged relative to the amount 
 of capital such entity holds and that is not subject 
 to capital requirements established by an appro- 
 priate Federal banking agency; and 
 “(bb) maintains a substantial position in out- 
 standing security-based swaps in any major secu- 
 rity-based swap category, as such categories are 
 determined by the Commission. 
 “(B) DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL POSITION.—For pur- 
 poses of subparagraph (A), the Commission shall define, 
 by rule or regulation, the term ‘substantial position’ at 
 the threshold that the Commission determines to be pru- 
 dent for the effective monitoring, management, and over- 
 sight of entities that are systemically important or can 
 significantly impact the financial system of the United 
 States. In setting the definition under this subparagraph, 
 the Commission shall consider the person’s relative position 
 in uncleared as opposed to cleared security-based swaps 
 and may take into consideration the value and quality 
 of collateral held against counterparty exposures. 
 “(C) SCOPE OF DESIGNATION.—For purposes of subpara- 
 graph (A), a person may be designated as a major security- 
 based swap participant for 1 or more categories of security- 
 based swaps without being classified as a major security- 
 based swap participant for all classes of security-based 
 swaps.

 “(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph

 to paragraph (47)(B)(x) of such section); and 
 “(ii) is based on— 
 “(I) an index that is a narrow-based 
 index, including any interest therein or on the 
 value thereof; 
 “(II) a single security or loan, including any 
 interest therein or on the value thereof; or 
 “(III) the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or extent 
 of the occurrence of an event relating to a single 
 issuer of a security or the issuers of securities 
 in a narrow-based security index, provided that 
 such event directly affects the financial state- 
 ments, financial condition, or financial obligations 
 of the issuer. 
 “(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION REGARDING MASTER 
 AGREEMENTS.—The term ‘security-based swap’ shall be con- 
 strued to include a master agreement that provides for 
 an agreement, contract, or transaction that is a security- 
 based swap pursuant to subparagraph (A), together with

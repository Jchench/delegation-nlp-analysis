‘‘(2) ALTERNATING EXAMINATIONS PERMITTED.—The

Board determines that an examination of a nondepository
institution subsidiary conducted by the State carries out the
purposes of this section.
‘‘(d) APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY BACKUP EXAMINA-
TION AUTHORITY.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In the event that the Board does not
conduct examinations required under subsection (b) in the same
manner, subject to the same standards, and with the same
frequency as would be required if such activities were conducted
by the lead insured depository institution subsidiary of the
depository institution holding company, the appropriate Federal
banking agency for the lead insured depository institution may
recommend in writing (which shall include a written expla-
nation of the concerns giving rise to the recommendation) that
the Board perform the examination required under subsection
(b).
‘‘(2) EXAMINATION BY AN APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING
AGENCY.—If the Board does not, before the end of the 60-
day period beginning on the date on which the Board receives
a recommendation under paragraph (1), begin an examination
as required under subsection (b) or provide a written expla-
nation to the appropriate Federal banking agency recom-
mending such examination responding to the concerns raised
by the appropriate Federal banking agency for the lead insured
depository institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency
for the lead insured depository institution may, subject to the

ties that are permissible for a depository institution subsidiary
conducted by such nondepository institution subsidiary (other
than a functionally regulated subsidiary or a subsidiary of
a depository institution) of the depository institution holding
company as if the nondepository institution subsidiary were
an insured depository institution for which the appropriate
Federal banking agency of the lead insured depository institu-
tion was the appropriate Federal banking agency, to determine
whether the activities—
‘‘(A) pose a material threat to the safety and soundness
of any insured depository institution subsidiary of the
depository institution holding company;
‘‘(B) are conducted in accordance with applicable Fed-
eral law; and
‘‘(C) are subject to appropriate systems for monitoring
and controlling the financial, operating, and other material
risks of the activities that may pose a material threat
to the safety and soundness of the insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the holding company.
‘‘(3) AGENCY COORDINATION WITH THE BOARD.—An appro-
priate Federal banking agency that conducts an examination
pursuant to paragraph (2) shall coordinate examination of the
activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries described in
subsection (b) with the Board in a manner that—
‘‘(A) avoids duplication; and
‘‘(B) shares information relevant to the supervision
of the depository institution holding company;

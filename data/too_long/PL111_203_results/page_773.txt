gage originator).
        ‘‘(ii) COMPUTATION.—For purposes of computing
     the total points and fees under this subparagraph,
     the total points and fees shall exclude either of the
     amounts described in the following subclauses, but not
     both:
            ‘‘(I) Up to and including 2 bona fide discount
        points payable by the consumer in connection with
        the mortgage, but only if the interest rate from
        which the mortgage’s interest rate will be dis-
        counted does not exceed by more than 1 percentage
        point the average prime offer rate.
            ‘‘(II) Unless 2 bona fide discount points have
        been excluded under subclause (I), up to and
        including 1 bona fide discount point payable by
        the consumer in connection with the mortgage,
        but only if the interest rate from which the mort-
        gage’s interest rate will be discounted does not
        exceed by more than 2 percentage points the aver-
        age prime offer rate.
        ‘‘(iii) BONA FIDE DISCOUNT POINTS DEFINED.—For
     purposes of clause (ii), the term ‘bona fide discount
     points’ means loan discount points which are knowingly
     paid by the consumer for the purpose of reducing
     and which in fact result in a bona fide reduction of,
     the interest rate or time-price differential applicable
     to the mortgage.
        ‘‘(iv) INTEREST RATE REDUCTION.—Subclauses (I)
     and (II) of clause (ii) shall not apply to discount points
     used to purchase an interest rate reduction unless
     the amount of the interest rate reduction purchased
     is reasonably consistent with established industry
     norms and practices for secondary mortgage market
     transactions.
        ‘‘(D) SMALLER LOANS.—The Board shall prescribe rules
     adjusting the criteria under subparagraph (A)(vi) in order
     to permit lenders that extend smaller loans to meet the
     requirements of the presumption of compliance under para-
     graph (1). In prescribing such rules, the Board shall con-
     sider the potential impact of such rules on rural areas
     and other areas where home values are lower.
        ‘‘(E) BALLOON LOANS.—The Board may, by regulation,
     provide that the term ‘qualified mortgage’ includes a bal-
     loon loan—
            ‘‘(i) that meets all of the criteria for a qualified
        mortgage under subparagraph (A) (except clauses
        (i)(I), (ii), (iv), and (v) of such subparagraph);
            ‘‘(ii) for which the creditor makes a determination
        that the consumer is able to make all scheduled pay-
        ments, except the balloon payment, out of income or
        assets other than the collateral;
            ‘‘(iii) for which the underwriting is based on a
        payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over

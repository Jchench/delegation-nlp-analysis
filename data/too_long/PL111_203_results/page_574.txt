    (a) EXEMPTION.—Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
is amended by adding at the end the following:
       “(c) EXEMPTION FOR SMALLER ISSUERS.—Subsection (b) shall

    that is neither a ‘large accelerated filer’ nor an ‘accelerated filer’
    as those terms are defined in Rule 12b–2 of the Commission (17
    C.F.R. 240.12b–2).”
    (b) STUDY.—The Securities and Exchange Commission shall
conduct a study to determine how the Commission could reduce
the burden of complying with section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 for companies whose market capitalization is between
$75,000,000 and $250,000,000 for the relevant reporting period

offerings. Not later than 9 months after the date of the enactment
of this subtitle, the Commission shall transmit a report of such
study to Congress.

Subtitle D—Preservation of State Law  

SEC. 1041. RELATION TO STATE LAW.  
(a) IN GENERAL.—  
(1) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—This title, other than sections  
1044 through 1048, may not be construed as annulling, altering,  
or affecting, or exempting any person subject to the provisions  
of this title from complying with, the statutes, regulations,  
orders, or interpretations in effect in any State, except to the  
extent that any such provision of law is inconsistent with  
the provisions of this title, and then only to the extent of  
the inconsistency.

the protection provided under this title. A determination  
regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation  
in effect in any State is inconsistent with the provisions of  
this title may be made by the Bureau on its own motion  
or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by any

of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the application  
of a law in effect in any State with respect to such Federal law.

of the States has enacted a resolution in support of the  
establishment or modification of a consumer protection regula-  
tion by the Bureau.  
(2) BUREAU CONSIDERATIONS REQUIRED FOR ISSUANCE OF  
FINAL REGULATION.—Before prescribing a final regulation based

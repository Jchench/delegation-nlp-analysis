Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78n(a)) is amended—
(1) by inserting ‘‘(1)’’ after ‘‘(a)’’; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(2) The rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission
under paragraph (1) may include—
‘‘(A) a requirement that a solicitation of proxy, consent,
or authorization by (or on behalf of) an issuer include a nominee
submitted by a shareholder to serve on the board of directors
of the issuer; and
‘‘(B) a requirement that an issuer follow a certain procedure
in relation to a solicitation described in subparagraph (A).’’.
(b) REGULATIONS.—The Commission may issue rules permitting
the use by a shareholder of proxy solicitation materials supplied
by an issuer of securities for the purpose of nominating individuals
to membership on the board of directors of the issuer, under such
terms and conditions as the Commission determines are in the
interests of shareholders and for the protection of investors.
(c) EXEMPTIONS.—The Commission may, by rule or order,
exempt an issuer or class of issuers from the requirement made
by this section or an amendment made by this section. In deter-
mining whether to make an exemption under this subsection, the
Commission shall take into account, among other considerations,
whether the requirement in the amendment made by subsection
(a) disproportionately burdens small issuers.

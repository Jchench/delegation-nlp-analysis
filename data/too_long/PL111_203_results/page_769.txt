by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determina- tion, based on verified and documented information, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the combined pay- ments of all loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.

‘‘(3) BASIS FOR DETERMINATION.—A determination under this subsection of a consumer’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer’s credit history, current income, expected income the consumer is reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt- to-income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obliga- tions, employment status, and other financial resources other than the consumer’s equity in the dwelling or real property that secures repayment of the loan.

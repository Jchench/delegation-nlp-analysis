            “(2) DEADLINE.—The Commission shall complete a review 
       undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1) not later than 90 days 
       after issuance of the stay, unless the clearing agency that 
       clears the security-based swap, or group, category, type, or 
       class of security-based swaps, agrees to an extension of the 
       time limitation established under this paragraph.
            “(3) DETERMINATION.—Upon completion of the review
       undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1), the Commission may—
                   “(A) determine, unconditionally or subject to such
           terms and conditions as the Commission determines to
           be appropriate, that the security-based swap, or group,
           category, type, or class of security-based swaps, must be
           cleared pursuant to this subsection if it finds that such
           clearing is consistent with subsection (b)(4); or
                   “(B) determine that the clearing requirement of sub-
           section (a)(1) shall not apply to the security-based swap,
           or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps.
            “(4) RULES.—Not later than 1 year after the date of the
       enactment of this section, the Commission shall adopt rules
       for reviewing, pursuant to this subsection, a clearing agency’s
       clearing of a security-based swap, or a group, category, type,
       or class of security-based swaps, that it has accepted for
       clearing.
            “(d) PREVENTION OF EVASION.—
                   “(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall prescribe rules
            under this section and issue interpretations of rules prescribed
            under this section, as determined by the Commission to be
            necessary to prevent evasions of the mandatory clearing
            requirements under this Act.
                   “(2) DUTY OF COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE AND TAKE CER-
            TAIN ACTIONS.—To the extent the Commission finds that a
            particular security-based swap or any group, category, type,
            or class of security-based swaps that would otherwise be subject
            to mandatory clearing but no clearing agency has listed the
            security-based swap or the group, category, type, or class of
            security-based swaps for clearing, the Commission shall—
                        “(A) investigate the relevant facts and circumstances;
                        “(B) within 30 days issue a public report containing
            the results of the investigation; and
                        “(C) take such actions as the Commission determines
            to be necessary and in the public interest, which may
            include requiring the retaining of adequate margin or cap-
            ital by parties to the security-based swap or the group,
            category, type, or class of security-based swaps; and
                   “(3) EFFECT ON AUTHORITY.—Nothing in this subsection—
                        “(A) authorizes the Commission to adopt rules
            requiring a clearing agency to list for clearing a security-
            based swap or any group, category, type, or class of secu-
            rity-based swaps if the clearing of the security-based swap
            or the group, category, type, or class of security-based
            swaps would threaten the financial integrity of the clearing
            agency; or
                        “(B) affects the authority of the Commission to enforce
            the open access provisions of subsection (a)(2) with respect
            to a security-based swap or the group, category, type, or
            class of security-based swaps that is listed for clearing
            by a clearing agency.

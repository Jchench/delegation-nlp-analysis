Subtitle H—Miscellaneous Provisions

SEC. 1491. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM TO
ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND REGULA-
TION OF THE TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE
CREDIT.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:

(1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were char-
tered by Congress to ensure a reliable and affordable supply
of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual legal status as privately
owned corporations with Government mandated affordable
housing goals.
(2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie
Mac’s mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income
levels below the median for a given area.
(3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of
their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally
mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac be ‘‘special affordable’’ loans made to
borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an area’s
median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent
for 2008.
(4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals,
in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development
authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime
securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.
(5) After this authorization to purchase subprime securities.
subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 percent of
securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while
the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8
percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding
increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 percent to
32.7 percent over the same period.
(6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased
$175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which
accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from
2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased
approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans,
while Fannie Mae’s acquisitions of mortgages with less than
10 percent down payments almost tripled.
(7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly
originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cur-
rently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the
United States and have insured mortgage-backed securities for
31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total
of 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United
States.
(8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury

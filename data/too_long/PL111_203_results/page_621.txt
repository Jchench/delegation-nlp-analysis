TION OF AUTHORITIES.
(a) EXCLUSION FOR MERCHANTS, RETAILERS, AND OTHER
SELLERS OF NONFINANCIAL GOODS OR SERVICES.—
(1) SALE OR BROKERAGE OF NONFINANCIAL GOOD OR
SERVICE.—The Bureau may not exercise any rulemaking, super-
visory, enforcement or other authority under this title with
respect to a person who is a merchant, retailer, or seller of any nonfinancial good or service and is engaged in the sale
or brokerage of such nonfinancial good or service, except to
the extent that such person is engaged in offering or providing
any consumer financial product or service, or is otherwise sub-
ject to any enumerated consumer law or any law for which
authorities are transferred under subtitle F or H.
(2) OFFERING OR PROVISION OF CERTAIN CONSUMER FINAN-
CIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE
OR BROKERAGE OF NONFINANCIAL GOOD OR SERVICE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), and subject to subparagraph (C), the Bureau may not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or other authority under this title with respect to a merchant,
retailer, or seller of nonfinancial goods or services,
only to the extent that such person—
(i) extends credit directly to a consumer, in a case
in which the good or service being provided is not
itself a consumer financial product or service (other
than credit described in this subparagraph), exclusively
for the purpose of enabling that consumer to purchase
such nonfinancial good or service directly from the
merchant, retailer, or seller;
(ii) directly, or through an agreement with another
person, collects debt arising from credit extended as
described in clause (i); or
(iii) sells or conveys debt described in clause (i)
that is delinquent or otherwise in default.
(B) APPLICABILITY.—Subparagraph (A) does not apply
to any credit transaction or collection of debt, other than
as described in subparagraph (C)(i), arising from a trans-
action described in subparagraph (A)—
(i) in which the merchant, retailer, or seller of
nonfinancial goods or services assigns, sells or other-
wise conveys to another person such debt owed by
the consumer (except for a sale of debt that is delin-
quent or otherwise in default, as described in subpara-
graph (A)(iii));
(ii) in which the credit extended significantly
exceeds the market value of the nonfinancial good or
service provided, or the Bureau otherwise finds that
the sale of the nonfinancial good or service is done
as a subterfuge, so as to evade or circumvent the
provisions of this title; or

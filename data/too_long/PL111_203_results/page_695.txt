           ‘‘(A) ADJUSTMENTS.—The Board may allow for an
          adjustment to the fee amount received or charged by an
          issuer under paragraph (2), if—
           ‘‘(i) such adjustment is reasonably necessary to
          make allowance for costs incurred by the issuer in
          preventing fraud in relation to electronic debit trans-
          actions involving that issuer; and
           ‘‘(ii) the issuer complies with the fraud-related
          standards established by the Board under subpara-
          graph (B), which standards shall—
          ‘‘(I) be designed to ensure that any fraud-
          related adjustment of the issuer is limited to the
          amount described in clause (i) and takes into
          account any fraud-related reimbursements
          (including amounts from charge-backs) received
          from consumers, merchants, or payment card net-
          works in relation to electronic debit transactions
          involving the issuer; and
          ‘‘(II) require issuers to take effective steps to
          reduce the occurrence of, and costs from, fraud
          in relation to electronic debit transactions,
          including through the development and
          implementation of cost-effective fraud prevention
          technology.

          making adjustments under this paragraph.
           ‘‘(ii) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In issuing the
          standards and prescribing regulations under this para-
          graph, the Board shall consider—
           ‘‘(I) the nature, type, and occurrence of fraud
          in electronic debit transactions;
           ‘‘(II) the extent to which the occurrence of
          fraud depends on whether authorization in an elec-
          tronic debit transaction is based on signature, PIN,
          or other means;
                                                       Deadline.

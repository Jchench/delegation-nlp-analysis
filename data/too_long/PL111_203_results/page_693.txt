    (a) STUDY REQUIRED.—
        (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall con­
        duct a study of and develop recommendations regarding the 
        options for ending the conservatorship of the Federal National
        Mortgage Association (in this section referred to as ‘‘Fannie  
        Mae’’) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (in 
        this section referred to as ‘‘Freddie Mac’’), while minimizing 
        the cost to taxpayers, including such options as—
            (A) the gradual wind-down and liquidation of such
                entities;
            (B) the privatization of such entities;
            (C) the incorporation of the functions of such entities
                into a Federal agency;
            (D) the dissolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
                into smaller companies; or
            (E) any other measures the Secretary determines
                appropriate.
        (2) ANALYSES.—The study required under paragraph (1)
            shall include an analysis of—
            (A) the role of the Federal Government in supporting
                a stable, well-functioning housing finance system, and 
                whether and to what extent the Federal Government should
                bear risks in meeting Federal housing finance objectives;
            (B) how the current structure of the housing finance
                system can be improved;
            (C) how the housing finance system should support
                the continued availability of mortgage credit to all segments
                of the market;
            (D) how the housing finance system should be struc­
                tured to ensure that consumers continue to have access
                to 30-year, fixed rate, pre-payable mortgages and other 
                mortgage products that have simple terms that can be 
                easily understood;
            (E) the role of the Federal Housing Administration
                and the Department of Veterans Affairs in a future housing
                finance system;
            (F) the impact of reforms of the housing finance system 
                on the financing of rental housing;
            (G) the impact of reforms of the housing finance system
                on secondary market liquidity;
            (H) the role of standardization in the housing finance 
                system;
            (I) how housing finance systems in other countries 
                offer insights that can help inform options for reform in
                the United States; and
            (J) the options for transition to a reformed housing
                finance system.

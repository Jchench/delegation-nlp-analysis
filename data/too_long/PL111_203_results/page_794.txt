    ‘‘(A) CERTIFICATION.—The Secretary shall provide for 
    the certification of various computer software programs 
    for consumers to use in evaluating different residential 
    mortgage loan proposals.  The Secretary shall require, for 
    such certification, that the mortgage software systems take 
    into account—
                    ‘‘(i) the consumer’s financial situation and the cost 
                       of maintaining a home, including insurance, taxes, and 
                       utilities;
                    ‘‘(ii) the amount of time the consumer expects to 
                       remain in the home or expected time to maturity of 
                       the loan; and
                    ‘‘(iii) such other factors as the Secretary considers 
                       appropriate to assist the consumer in evaluating 
                       whether to pay points, to lock in an interest rate, 
                       to select an adjustable or fixed rate loan, to select 
                       a conventional or government-insured or guaranteed 
                       loan and to make other choices during the loan applica 
                       tion process.
    If the Secretary determines that available existing software 
    is inadequate to assist consumers during the residential 
    mortgage loan application process, the Secretary shall 
    arrange for the development by private sector software 
    companies of new mortgage software systems that meet 
    the Secretary's specifications.

          ‘‘(B) USE AND INITIAL AVAILABILITY.—Such certified 
    computer software programs shall be used to supplement, 
    not replace, housing counseling. The Secretary shall provide
    that such programs are initially used only in connection 
    with the assistance of housing counselors certified pursuant 
    to subsection (e).
        ‘‘(C) AVAILABILlTY.—After a period of initial availability 
    under subparagraph (B) as the Secretary considers appro 
    priate, the Secretary shall take reasonable steps to make 
    mortgage software systems certified pursuant to this para 
    graph widely available through the Internet and at public 
    locations, including public libraries, senior-citizen centers, 
    public housing sites, offices of public housing agencies that 
    administer rental housing assistance vouchers, and housing 
    counseling centers.
        ‘‘(D) BUDGET COMPLlANCE.–This paragraph shall be
    effective only to the extent that amounts to carry out 
    this paragraph are made available in advance in appropria 
    tions Acts.

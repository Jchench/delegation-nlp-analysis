production of any such records may be required from any place
in the United States, any State, or any foreign country or
jurisdiction at any designated place of hearing.
"(7) SERVICE.—A subpoena issued under this section may
be served upon any person who is not to be found within
the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States

the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda,
and other records. Such court may issue an order requiring

Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give
testimony touching the matter under investigation or in ques-
tion.

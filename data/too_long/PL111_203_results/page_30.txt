124 STAT. 1404           PUBLIC LAW 111–203—JULY 21, 2010

(2) PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR FOREIGN FINANCIAL COMPA-
 NIES.—In making recommendations concerning the standards
 set forth in paragraph (1) that would apply to foreign nonbank 
 financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or
 foreign-based bank holding companies, the Council shall—

(A) give due regard to the principle of national treat-
 ment and equality of competitive opportunity; and

(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign 
 nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding 
 company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country 
 standards that are comparable to those applied to financial 
 companies in the United States.

(3) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making recommendations con-
 cerning prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council 
 shall—
(A) take into account differences among nonbank finan-
 cial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and 
 bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based 
 on—
(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and 
 (b) of section 113;
(ii) whether the company owns an insured deposi-
 tory institution;
(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the 
 company; and
(iv) any other factors that the Council determines 
 appropriate;
(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes 
 in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 
 113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in 
 the prudential standards established under section 165; 
 and
(C) adapt its recommendations as appropriate in light 
 of any predominant line of business of such company, 
 including assets under management or other activities for 
 which particular standards may not be appropriate.

(c) CONTINGENT CAPITAL.—

(1) STUDY REQUIRED.—The Council shall conduct a study 
 of the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent 
 capital requirement for nonbank financial companies supervised
 by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies 
 described in subsection (a), which study shall include—  

(A) an evaluation of the degree to which such require-
 ment would enhance the safety and soundness of companies 
 subject to the requirement, promote the financial stability 
 of the United States, and reduce risks to United States 
 taxpayers;
(B) an evaluation of the characteristics and amounts 
 of contingent capital that should be required;
(C) an analysis of potential prudential standards that 
 should be used to determine whether the contingent capital 
 of a company would be converted to equity in times of 
 financial stress;
(D) an evaluation of the costs to companies, the effects 
 on the structure and operation of credit and other financial 
 markets, and other economic effects of requiring contingent 
 capital;

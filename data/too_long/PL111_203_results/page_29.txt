SEC. 115. ENHANCED SUPERVISION AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS
               FOR NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES SUPERVISED BY
               THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND CERTAIN BANK HOLDING
               COMPANIES.

(a) IN GENERAL.—
        (1) PURPOSE.—In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the establishment and refinement of prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and large, interconnected bank holding companies, that—
            (A) are more stringent than those applicable to other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and
            (B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).
        (2) RECOMMENDED APPLICATION OF REQUIRED STANDARDS.— In making recommendations under this section, the Council may—
            (A) differentiate among companies that are subject to heightened standards on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk- related factors that the Council deems appropriate; or
            (B) recommend an asset threshold that is higher than $50,000,000,000 for the application of any standard described in subsections (c) through (g).
(b) DEVELOPMENT OF PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS.—
        (1) IN GENERAL.—The recommendations of the Council under subsection (a) may include—
            (A) risk-based capital requirements;
            (B) leverage limits;
            (C) liquidity requirements;
            (D) resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements;
            (E) concentration limits;
            (F) a contingent capital requirement;
            (G) enhanced public disclosures;
            (H) short-term debt limits; and
            (I) overall risk management requirements.

        amount of obligations under this subsection—
                (i) the Corporation shall include as an obligation 
            any contingent liability of the Corporation pursuant 
            to this title; and

            (A) ORDERLY LIQUIDATION PLAN.—Amounts in the Fund 
        shall be available to the Corporation with regard to a 
        covered financial company for which the Corporation is 
        appointed receiver after the Corporation has developed an 
        orderly liquidation plan that is acceptable to the Secretary 
        with regard to such covered financial company, including 
        the provision and use of funds, including taking any actions 
        specified under section 204(d) and subsection (h)(2)(G)(iv) 
        and (h)(9) of this section, and payments to third parties. 
        The orderly liquidation plan shall take into account actions 
        to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects on low income, 
        minority, or underserved communities affected by the 
        failure of the covered financial company, and shall provide 
        for coordination with the primary financial regulatory agen-
        cies, as appropriate, to ensure that such actions are taken.
        The Corporation may, at any time, amend any orderly 
        liquidation plan approved by the Secretary with the concur-
        rence of the Secretary.

            Corporation that—
                    (I) provides a specific plan and schedule to 
                achieve the repayment of the outstanding amount 
                of any borrowing under paragraph (5); and
                    (II) demonstrates that income to the Corpora-

                cial company and assessments under subsection

                balance within the period established in the repay-
                ment schedule and pay the interest accruing on 
                such balance within the time provided in sub-

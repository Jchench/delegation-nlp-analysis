the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate estimating the amount of detention space that will be required, during the fiscal year in which the report is submit- ted and the succeeding fiscal year, to detain—
(A) all aliens subject to detention under section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as amended by section 303 of this title) and section 241(a) of the Immigra- tion and Nationality Act (as inserted by section 305(a)(3) of this title);
(B) all excludable or deportable aliens subject to proceedings under section 238 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as redesignated by section 308(b)(5) of this title) or section 235(b)(2)(A) or 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and 
(C) other excludable or deportable aliens in accordance with the priorities established by the Attorney General.
EˆSTIMATE OF NUMBER OF ALIENS RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY. 
(A) C  ALIENS.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—The first report submitted under paragraph (1) shall include an estimate of the number of criminal aliens who, in each of the 3 fiscal years concluded prior to the date of the report—
(I) were released from detention facilities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (whether operated directly by the Service or through contract with other persons or agencies); or 
(II) were not taken into custody or detention by the Service upon completion of their incarceration.
(ii) A  CONVICTED OF AGGRAVATED FELONIES.— The estimate under clause (i) shall estimate separately, with respect to each year described in such clause, the number of criminal aliens described in such clause who were convicted of an aggravated felony.
(B) ALL EXCLUDABLE OR DEPORTABLE ALIENS.—The first report submitted under paragraph (1) shall also estimate the number of excludable or deportable aliens who were released into the community due to a lack of detention facilities in each of the 3 fiscal years concluded prior to the date of the report notwithstanding circumstances that the Attorney General believed justified detention (for exam- ple, a significant probability that the released alien will not appear, as agreed, at subsequent exclusion or deporta- tion proceedings).
(C) SUBSEQUENT REPORTS.—Each report under para- graph (1) following the first such report shall include the estimates under subparagraphs (A) and (B), made with respect to the 6-month period immediately preceding the date of the submission of the report.

                          Secretary.
                            (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or
                          regulation, the cost (as that term is defined by the Federal

                            or averaged risk; and
                              (B) may not be used in determining the cost of any
                            other project, type of project, or averaged risk applicable
                            to guarantees or commitments to guarantee issued under
                            title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 App. U.S.C.
                            1271 et seq.).
                            (e) SUNSET.—No commitment to guarantee obligations under

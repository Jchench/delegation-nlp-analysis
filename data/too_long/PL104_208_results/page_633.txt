(2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the Presi- 
dent may consider providing for appropriate compensation, subject 
to the availability of appropriations, in cases where the United 
States is able to independently verify the adequacy of the sites 
where aliens will be imprisoned and the length of time the alien 
is actually incarcerated in the foreign country under such a treaty.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the Congress that— 
(1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements should 
be— 
    (A) to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in 
    the United States who are (or are about to be) incarcerated 
    in United States prisons, 
    (B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the 
    balance of the sentence imposed by the United States 
    courts, 
    (C) to eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent 
    to such a transfer, and 
    (D) to permit the Federal Government or the States 
    to keep their original prison sentences in force for 
    transferred prisoners who return to the United States prior 
    to the completion of their original United States sentences 
    can be returned to custody for the balance of their prison 
    sentences; 
(2) the Secretary of State should give priority to concluding 
an agreement with any country for which the President deter-

States; and 
(3) no treaty providing for the transfer of aliens from 
Federal, State, or local incarceration facilities to a foreign incar- 
ceration facility should permit the alien to refuse the transfer. 

(c) PRISONER CONSENT.—Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, except as required by treaty, the transfer of an alien from 
a Federal, State, or local incarceration facility under an agreement 
of the type referred to in subsection (a) shall not require consent 
of the alien. 

(d) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney 
General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary 
of the House of Representatives and of the Senate stating whether 
each prisoner transfer treaty to which the United States is a party 
has been effective in the preceding 12 months in bringing about 
the return of deportable incarcerated aliens to the country of which 
they are nationals and in ensuring that they serve the balance 
of their sentences. 

(e) TRAINING FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL.—(1) 
Subject to paragraph (2), the President shall direct the Border

           alien may be inadmissible under subparagraph (A) (other than
           clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of section 212(a)(3), the officer or judge
           shall—
                 "(A) order the alien removed, subject to review under
                 paragraph (2);
                 "(B) report the order of removal to the Attorney Gen-

                 that the alien is inadmissible under subparagraph (A)
                 (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of section 212(a)(3),

                 "(ii) after consulting with appropriate security agencies
                 of the United States Government, concludes that disclo-
                 sure of the information would be prejudicial to the public
                 interest, safety, or security,

                 further inquiry or hearing by an immigration judge.
                     ‘‘(C) If the Attorney General does not order the removal
                 of the alien under subparagraph (B), the Attorney General
                 shall specify the further inquiry or hearing that shall be con-
                 ducted in the case.

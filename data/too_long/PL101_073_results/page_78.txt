           "(A) ASSISTANCE PROPOSALS.-The Corporation shall con-
                sider proposals by Savings Association Insurance Fund

                grounds exist for appointment of a conservator or receiver
                for such  member under the following circumstances:
               "(i) TROUBLED CONDITION CRITERIA.-The Corporation
                  determines-
                   "(I) that grounds for appointment of a conserva-
                        tor or receiver exist or likely will exist in the
                        future unless the member's tangible capital is in-
                        creased;
                   "(II) that it is unlikely that the member can
                        achieve positive tangible capital without assist-
                        ance; and
                  "(III) that providing assistance pursuant to the
                        member's proposal would be likely to lessen the
                        risk to the Corporation.
               "(ii) OTHER CRITERIA.-The member meets the follow-
                   ing criteria:
                   "(I) Before enactment of the Financial Institu-
                        tions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
                        1989, the member was solvent under applicable
                        regulatory accounting principles but had negative
                        tangible capital.
                  "(II) The member's negative tangible capital
                         position is substantially attributable to its partici-
                         pation in acquisitions and merger transactions that
                         were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank
                         Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
                         Corporation for supervisory reasons.
                  "(III) The member is a qualified thrift lender (as
                         defined in section 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan
                         Act) or would be a qualified thrift lender if

“(14) PAYMENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS.-(A) The new bank shall
assume as transferred deposits the payment of the insured
deposits of such bank in default to each of its depositors.
“(B) Of the amounts so made available, the Corporation shall
transfer to the new bank, in cash, such sums as may be nec­
essary to enable it to meet its expenses of operation and imme­
diate cash demands on such transferred deposits, and the
remainder of such amounts shall be subject to withdrawal by
the new bank on demand.
“(15) ISSUANCE OF STOCK.-(A) Whenever in the judgment of
the Board of Directors it is desirable to do so, the Corporation
shall cause capital stock of the new bank to be offered for sale
on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
deem advisable in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of the
Board of Directors, to make possible the conduct of the business
of the new bank on a sound basis, but in no event less than that
required by section 5138 of the Revised Statutes for the
organization of a national bank in the place where such new
bank is located.
“(B) The stockholders of the insured bank in default shall be
given the first opportunity to purchase any shares of common
stock so offered.
“(16) ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE.-Upon proof that an adequate
amount of capital stock in the new bank has been subscribed
and paid for in cash, the Comptroller of the Currency shall
require the articles of association and the organization certifi­
cate to be amended to conform to the requirements for the
organization of a national bank, and thereafter, when the
requirements of law with respect to the organization of a na­
tional bank have been complied with, the Comptroller of the
Currency shall issue to the bank a certificate of authority to
commence business, and thereupon the bank shall cease to have
the status of a new bank, shall be managed by directors elected
by its own shareholders, may exercise all the powers granted by
law, and shall be subject to all provisions of law relating to
national banks. Such bank shall thereafter be an insured na­
tional bank, without certification to or approval by the Corpora­
tion.
“(17) TRANSFER TO OTHER INSTITUTION.-If the capital stock of
the new bank is not offered for sale, or if an adequate amount of
capital for such new bank is not subscribed and paid for, the
Board of Directors may offer to transfer its business to any
insured depository institution in the same community which
will take over its assets, assume its liabilities, and pay to the
Corporation for such business such amount as the Board of
Directors may deem adequate; or the Board of Directors in its
discretion may change the location of the new bank to the office
of the Corporation or to some other place or may at any time
wind up its affairs as herein provided.
“(18) WINDING UP.-Unless the capital stock of the new bank
is sold or its assets are taken over and its liabilities are assumed
by an insured depository institution as above provided within 2
years after the date of its organization, the Corporation shall
wind up the affairs of such bank, after giving such notice, if any,
as the Comptroller of the Currency may require, and shall
certify to the Comptroller of the Currency the termination of

of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, except in accordance with this paragraph. In every case, the Director shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and association involved, the effect of the acquisition on the association, the insurance risk to the Savings Association Insurance Fund or the Bank Insurance Fund, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and shall render a decision within 90 days after submission to the Director of the complete record on the application. Before approving any such acquisition, except a transaction under section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Director shall request from the Attorney General and consider any report rendered within 30 days on the competitive factors involved. The Director shall not approve any proposed acquisition—

“(B) such company controls a savings association subsidiary which operated a home or branch office in the additional State or States as of March 5, 1987; or
“(C) the statutes of the State in which the savings association to be acquired is located permit a savings association chartered by such State to be acquired by a savings association chartered by the State where the acquiring savings association or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a State chartered savings association, and such statutes specifically authorize such an acquisition by language to that effect and not merely by implication.
“(4)  ACQUISITIONS BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.—
“(A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subsection (h)(2), any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns, controls, or holds with power to vote (or holds proxies representing) more than 25 percent of the voting shares of such holding company, may acquire control of any savings association not a subsidiary of such

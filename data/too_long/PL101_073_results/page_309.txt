 “(A) IN GENERAL.--If the Board of Directors initiates a termination proceeding under paragraph (2), and the Board of  Directors, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency, finds that an insured depository institution (other than a savings association to which subparagraph (B) applies) has no tangible capital under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the Corporation may issue a temporary order suspending deposit insurance on all deposits received by the institution.

“(B) SPECIAL RULE FOR CERTAIN SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS.--

103 STAT. 344        PUBLIC LAW 101-73—AUG. 9, 1989

"(A) the savings association's qualified thrift investments
equal or exceed 70 percent of the savings association's
portfolio assets; and
"(B) the savings association's qualified thrift investments
continue to equal or exceed 70 percent of the savings
association's portfolio assets, as measured by a daily or
weekly average of such qualified thrift investments and
such portfolio assets, for the 2-year period beginning on
July 1, 1991, and for each 2-year period thereafter.
"(2) EXCEPTIONS GRANTED BY DIRECTOR.—Notwithstanding
paragraph (1), the Director may grant such temporary and
limited exceptions from the minimum actual thrift investment
percentage requirement contained in such paragraph as the
Director deems necessary if—
"(A) the Director determines that extraordinary circumstances exist, such as when the effects of high interest
rates reduce mortgage demand to such a degree that an
insufficient opportunity exists for a savings association to
meet such investment requirements; or
"(B) the Director determines that—
"(i) the grant of any such exception will significantly
facilitate an acquisition under section 13(c) or 13(k) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;
"(ii) the acquired association will comply with the
transition requirements of paragraph (7)(B), as if the
date of the exemption were the starting date for the
transition period described in that paragraph; and
"(iii) the Director determines that the exemption will
not have an undue adverse effect on competing savings
associations in the relevant market and will further
the purposes of this subsection.

"(B) RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS
THAT ARE NOT QUALIFIED THRIFT LENDERS.—
"(i) RESTRICTIONS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.—The following restrictions shall apply to a savings association
beginning on the date on which the savings association
should have become or ceases to be a qualified thrift
lender:
"(I) ACTIVITIES.—The savings association shall
not make any new investment (including an investment in a subsidiary) or engage, directly or indirectly, in any other new activity unless that
investment or activity would be permissible for the

is also permissible for the savings association as a
savings association.
"(II) BRANCHING.—The savings association shall
not establish any new branch office at any location
at which a national bank located in the savings

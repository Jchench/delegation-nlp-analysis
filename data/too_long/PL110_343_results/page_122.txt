        (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with 
        such a plan), if the application of this section to such 
        plan (or coverage) results in an increase for the plan year 
        involved of the actual total costs of coverage with respect 
        to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and 
        substance use disorder benefits under the plan (as deter-

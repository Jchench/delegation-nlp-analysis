SEC. 506. MODIFICATION OF PENALTY ON UNDERSTATEMENT OF TAX-
PAYER’S LIABILITY BY TAX RETURN PREPARER.
26 USC 6694.
       (a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (a) of section 6694 is amended
to read as follows:
``(a) UNDERSTATEMENT DUE TO UNREASONABLE POSITIONS.—
       ``(1) IN GENERAL.—If a tax return preparer—
                    ``(A) prepares any return or claim of refund with respect
               to which any part of an understatement of liability is
               due to a position described in paragraph (2), and
                    ``(B) knew (or reasonably should have known) of the
               position,
such tax return preparer shall pay a penalty with respect
to each such return or claim in an amount equal to the greater
of $1,000 or 50 percent of the income derived (or to be derived)
by the tax return preparer with respect to the return or claim.
        ``(2) UNREASONABLE POSITION.—
                    ``(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise provided in
               this paragraph, a position is described in this paragraph
                unless there is or was substantial authority for the
               position.
                    ``(B) DISCLOSED POSITIONS.—If the position was dis-
               closed as provided in section 6662(d)(2)(B)(ii)(I) and is not
               a position to which subparagraph (C) applies, the position
               is described in this paragraph unless there is a reasonable
               basis for the position.
                    ``(C) TAX SHELTERS AND REPORTABLE TRANSACTIONS.—
               If the position is with respect to a tax shelter (as defined
               in section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii)) or a reportable transaction to
               which section 6662A applies, the position is described in
               this paragraph unless it is reasonable to believe that the
               position would more likely than not be sustained on its
               merits.
        ``(3) REASONABLE CAUSE EXCEPTION.—No penalty shall be
imposed under this subsection if it is shown that there is
reasonable cause for the understatement and the tax return
preparer acted in good faith.’ ’’.
       (b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by this section
shall apply—
             (1) in the case of a position other than a position described
     in subparagraph (C) of section 6694(a)(2) of the Internal Rev-
     enue Code of 1986 (as amended by this section), to returns
     prepared after May 25, 2007, and
             (2) in the case of a position described in such subparagraph
     (C), to returns prepared for taxable years ending after the
     date of the enactment of this Act.

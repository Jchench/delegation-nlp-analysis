“(II) a machine-readable definition of the rela- Definition of the 
      tionship between the delivered interface and 
      existing common standards or interfaces available
      in Department interface repositories; and 
        “(III) documentation with functional descrip-
      tions of software-defined interfaces, conveying 
      semantic meaning of interface elements, such as
      the function of a given interface field;’’; and
      (III) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ‘‘and 
      modular systems’’ after ‘‘severable major system
      components’’;
      (ii) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ‘‘well-defined
     major system interfaces’’ and inserting ‘‘modular 
     system interfaces’’;
      (iii) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:
        ‘‘(4) The term ‘modular system interface’ means a shared 
        boundary between major systems, major system components,
Definition.           or modular systems, defined by various physical, logical, and 
functional characteristics, such as electrical, mechanical, fluidic, 
optical, radio frequency, data, networking, or software ele-
ments.’’;
         (iv) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (8)
         as paragraphs (6) through (9), respectively; and 
         (v) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following
         new paragraph:
          ‘‘(5) The term ‘modular system’ refers to a weapon system
          or weapon system component that— 
              ‘‘(A) is able to execute without requiring coincident
              execution of other specific weapon systems or components; 
              ‘‘(B) can communicate across component boundaries
              and through interfaces; and
              ‘‘(C) functions as a module that can be separated, 
              recombined, and connected with other weapon systems or weapon system components in order to achieve various effects, missions, or capabilities.’’
          (2) RIGHTS IN TECHNICAL DATA.—
            (A) IN GENERAL.—Section 2320 of title 10, United
           States Code, is amended—
             (i) in subsection (a)(2), by amending subparagraph 
                                (G) to read as follows:
                                ‘‘(G) MODULAR SYSTEM INTERFACES DEVELOPED EXCLU-
                                SIVELY AT PRIVATE EXPENSE OR WITH MIXED FUNDING.—Notwith-
Determination.            standing subparagraphs (B) and (E), the United States shall 
have government purpose rights in technical data pertaining 
to a modular system interface developed exclusively at private 
expense or in part with Federal funds and in part at private 
expense and used in a modular open system approach pursuant 
to section 2446a of this title, except in any case in which 
the Secretary of Defense determines that negotiation of dif-
ferent rights in such technical data would be in the best interest 
of the United States. Such modular system interface shall be 
identified in the contract solicitation and the contract. For 
technical data pertaining to a modular system interface devel-
oped exclusively at private expense for which the United States 
asserts government purpose rights, the Secretary of Defense 
shall negotiate with the contractor the appropriate and reason-
able compensation for such technical data.’’; and

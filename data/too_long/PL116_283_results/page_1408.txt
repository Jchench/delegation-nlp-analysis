134 STAT. 4794          PUBLIC LAW 116–283—JAN. 1, 2021

            (4) ways to improve the ability of covered agencies to meet 
      mission requirements in congested environments with respect 
      to Federal spectrum, including as part of automated adjust-
      ments to operations  based on changing conditions in such 
      environments;
            (5) the creation of a time-based automated mechanism—
                 (A) to share Federal spectrum between covered agen-
      cies to collaboratively and dynamically increase access to 
      Federal spectrum by such agencies; and
                 (B) that could be scaled across Federal spectrum; and
            (6) the collaboration between covered agencies necessary 
      to ensure the interoperability of Federal spectrum.
                         (b) SPECTRUM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION.—
                  (1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 240 days after the date 
      of the enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary of Com-
      merce for Communications and Information shall submit to 
      Congress a report that contains a plan for the National Tele-
      communications and Information Administration (in this sec-
      tion referred to as the ‘‘NTIA’’) to modernize and automate 
      the infrastructure of the NTIA relating to managing the use 
      of Federal spectrum by covered agencies so as to more efficiently 
      manage such use.
                  (2) CONTENTS.—The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
      include—
                         (A) an assessment of the current, as of the date on 
      which such report is submitted, infrastructure of the NTIA 
      described in such paragraph;
                         (B) an acquisition strategy for the modernized infra-
      structure of the NTIA described in such paragraph, 
      including how such modernized infrastructure will enable 
      covered agencies to be more efficient and effective in the 
      use of Federal spectrum;
                         (C) a timeline for the implementation of the moderniza-
      tion efforts described in such paragraph; and
                         (D) plans detailing how the modernized infrastructure 
      of the NTIA described in such paragraph will—
                              (i) enhance the security and reliability of such 
      infrastructure so that the NTIA is in compliance with 
      the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 35 of 
      title 44, United States Code, with respect to such infra-
      structure;
                              (ii) improve data models and analysis tools to 
      increase the efficiency of the spectrum use described 
      in such paragraph;
                              (iii) enhance automation and workflows, and 
      reduce the scope and level of manual effort, in order 
      to—
                                   (I) administer the management of the spec-
      trum use described in such paragraph; and
                                   (II) improve data quality and processing time; 
      and
                         (iv) improve the timeliness of spectrum analyses 
      and requests for information, including requests sub-
      mitted pursuant to section 552 of title 5, United States 
      Code;

134 STAT. 4580            PUBLIC LAW 116–283—JAN. 1, 2021

    (2) nonprofit organizations based in the United States with international activities often face difficulties with financial access, most commonly the inability to send funds internationally through transparent, regulated financial channels;
    (3) without access to timely and predictable banking services, nonprofit organizations, including international development organizations, cannot carry out essential humanitarian activities critical to the survival of those in affected communities;
    (4) similar access issues are a concern for other underserved individuals and entities such as those sending remittances from the United States to their families overseas and certain domestic and overseas jurisdictions that have experienced curtailed access to cross-border financial services due, in part, to de-risking;
    (5) the financial exclusion caused by de-risking can ultimately drive money into less transparent, shadow channels through the carrying of cash or use of unlicensed or unregistered money service remitters, thus reducing transparency and traceability, which are critical for financial integrity, and can increase the risk of money falling into the wrong hands;
    (6) effective measures are needed to stop the flow of illicit funds and promote the goals of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions regimes;
    (7) anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and sanctions policies are needed that do not unduly hinder or delay the efforts of legitimate humanitarian organizations in providing assistance to—
    (A) meet the needs of civilians facing a humanitarian crisis, including enabling governments and humanitarian organizations to provide them with timely access to food, health, and medical care, shelter, and clean drinking water; and
    (B) prevent or alleviate human suffering, in keeping with requirements of international humanitarian law;
    (8) anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and sanctions policies must ensure that the policies do not unduly hinder or delay legitimate access to the international financial system for underserved individuals, entities, and geographic areas;
    (9) policies that ensure that incidental, inadvertent benefits that may indirectly benefit a designated group in the course of delivering life-saving aid to civilian populations are not the primary focus of Federal Government enforcement efforts;
    (10) policies that encourage financial inclusion, particularly of underserved populations, must remain a priority; and
    (11) laws, regulations, policies, guidance, and other measures that ensure the integrity of the financial system through a risk-based approach should be prioritized.

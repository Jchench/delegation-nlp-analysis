134 STAT. 3948           PUBLIC LAW 116–283—JAN. 1, 2021

        (4) the 2018 National Defense Strategy identifies long-
    term strategic competition with Russia as a principal priority
    and highlights the essential role that a strong NATO alliance
    must play in implementing that strategy and addressing shared
    security concerns;
        (5) the United States should deepen defense cooperation
    with non-NATO European partners, reaffirm the open-door
    policy of NATO, and encourage security sector cooperation
    between NATO and non-NATO defense partners that com-
    plements and strengthens collective defense, interoperability,
    and allies’ commitment to Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty;
        (6) bolstering NATO cohesion and enhancing security rela-
    tionships with non-NATO European partners to counter Rus-
    sian aggression, including Russia’s use of hybrid warfare tactics
    and its willingness to use military power to alter the status
    quo, strengthens the United States security interests for the
    long-term strategic competition;
        (7) the continued prioritization of funding for the European
    Deterrence Initiative, including for purposes of strengthening
    allied and partner capability and power projection along the
    eastern flank of NATO, remains critically important;
        (8) the United States and NATO should continue to
    cooperate on other major shared challenges, such as the COVID-
    19 pandemic; and
        (9) the policy of the United States should be to work
    with its NATO and other allies and partners to build permanent
    mechanisms to strengthen supply chains, enhance supply chain
    security, fill supply chain gaps, and maintain commitments
    made at the June 2020 NATO Defense Ministerial, particularly
    regarding pandemic response preparations.
                
SEC. 1245. LIMITATION ON UNITED STATES FORCE STRUCTURE REDUC-
                     TIONS IN GERMANY.

    (a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—
        (1) the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be a
    strong ally within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO) and a critical ally of the United States;
        (2) the presence of the United States Armed Forces in
    Germany serves as a strong deterrent to Russian Federation
    military aggression and expansion in Europe and as an essen-
    tial support platform for carrying out vital national security
    engagements in the Middle East, Africa, and Afghanistan;
        (3) the presence of approximately 34,500 members of the
    United States Armed Forces deployed to Germany, and the
    ability to increase that level as necessary in response to global
    security challenges, is essential to supporting NATO’s oper-
    ations and its collective deterrence against threats;
        (4) reducing the number of members of the United States
    Armed Forces in Germany during a time of growing threats
    in Europe would constitute a grave strategic mistake that would
    undermine United States national security interests and
    weaken NATO; and
        (5) the United States should continue—
            (A) to maintain and strengthen its bilateral relation-
        ship with Germany; and

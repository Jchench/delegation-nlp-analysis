        protected areas such as sanctuaries) and protected spe-
        cies, and such program shall’’;
            (ii) by redesignating clauses (iii) and (iv) as clauses

            of sublethal impacts of oil discharge on living natural
            marine resources, including impacts on pelagic fish species,
            marine mammals, and commercially and recreationally tar-
            geted fish and shellfish species.’’; and
            (iv) by adding at the end the following:
                ‘‘(vi) Research to understand the long-term effects of
            major oil discharges and the long-term effects of smaller
            endemic oil discharges.
                ‘‘(vii) The identification of potential impacts on eco-
            systems, habitat, and wildlife from the additional toxicity,
            heavy metal concentrations, and increased corrosiveness
            of mixed crude, such as diluted bitumen crude.
                ‘‘(viii) The development of methods to restore and
            rehabilitate natural resources and ecosystem functions
            damaged by oil discharges.’’;
        (E) in paragraph (5) by striking ‘‘this subsection’’ and
    inserting ‘‘paragraph (1)’’;

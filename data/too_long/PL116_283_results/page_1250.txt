134 STAT. 4636                PUBLIC LAW 116–283—JAN. 1, 2021

    (2) A recent study found that the Great Lakes shipping
industry supports 237,000 jobs and tens of billions of dollars
in economic activity.
    (3) United States Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is cru-
cial to full utilization of the Great Lakes shipping system,
as during the winter icebreaking season up to 15 percent of
annual cargo loads are delivered, and many industries would
have to reduce their production if Coast Guard icebreaking
services were not provided.
    (4) 6 of the Coast Guard’s 9 icebreaking cutters in the
Great Lakes are more than 30 years old and are frequently
inoperable during the winter icebreaking season, including
those that have completed a recent service life extension pro-
gram.
    (5) During the previous 10 winters, Coast Guard Great
Lakes icebreaking cutters have been inoperable for an average
of 65 cutter-days during the winter icebreaking season, with
this annual lost capability exceeding 100 cutter days, with
a high of 246 cutter days during the winter of 2017–2018.
    (6) The 2019 ice season provides further proof that current
Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is inadequate for the needs
of the Great Lakes shipping industry, as only 6 of the 9
icebreaking cutters are operational, and millions of tons of
cargo was not loaded or was delayed due to inadequate Coast
Guard icebreaking assets during a historically average winter
for Great Lakes ice coverage.
    (7) The Congress has authorized the Coast Guard to acquire
a new Great Lakes icebreaker as capable as Coast Guard
Cutter Mackinaw (WLBB–30), the most capable Great Lakes
icebreaker, and $10 million has been appropriated to fund
the design and initial acquisition work for this icebreaker.
    (8) The Coast Guard has not initiated an acquisition
program for this Great Lakes icebreaker.
    (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the Congress
of the United States that a new Coast Guard icebreaker as capable
as Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw (WLBB–30) is needed on the
Great Lakes, and the Coast Guard should acquire this icebreaker
as soon as possible.

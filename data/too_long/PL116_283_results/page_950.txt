                  SEC. 2827. IMPROVING WATER MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY ON MILI-
                    TARY INSTALLATIONS.

                  (a) RISK-BASED APPROACH TO INSTALLATION WATER MANAGE-
                    MENT AND SECURITY.—
Determination.                (1) GENERAL REQUIREMENT.—The Secretary concerned shall
                         adopt a risk-based approach to water management and security
                         for each military installation under the jurisdiction of the Sec-
                         retary.
                             (2) IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES.—The Secretary concerned
                          shall begin implementation of paragraph (1) by prioritizing
                          those military installations under the jurisdiction of the Sec-
                          retary that the Secretary determines—
                                  (A) are experiencing the greatest risks to sustainable
                             water management and security; and
Assessments.                 (B) face the most severe existing or potential adverse
                               impacts to mission assurance as a result of such risks.
                          (3) DETERMINATION METHOD.—Determinations under para-
                       graph (2) shall be made on the basis of the water management
                       and security assessments made by the Secretary concerned
                       under subsection (b).
                     (b) WATER MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY ASSESSMENTS.—
                         (1) ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY.—The Secretaries con-
                      cerned, acting jointly, shall develop a methodology to assess
                      risks to sustainable water management and security and mis-
Evaluations.          sion assurance.
                          (2) ELEMENTS.—Required elements of the assessment meth-
                       odology shall include the following:
                              (A) An evaluation of the water sources and supply
                         connections for a military installation, including water flow
                         rate and extent of competition for the water sources.
                               (B) An evaluation of the age, condition, and jurisdic-
                          tional control of water infrastructure serving the military
                          installation.
                              (C) An evaluation of the military installation’s water-
                         security risks related to drought-prone climates, impacts
                         of defense water usage on regional water demands, water
                         quality, and legal issues, such as water rights disputes.
                               (D) An evaluation of the resiliency of the military
                          installation’s water supply and the overall health of the
                          aquifer basin of which the water supply is a part, including
                          the robustness of the resource, redundancy, and ability
                          to recover from disruption.
                               (E) An evaluation of existing water metering and
                          consumption at the military installation, considered at a
                          minimum—
                               (i) by type of installation activity, such as training,
                              maintenance, medical, housing, and grounds mainte-
                              nance and landscaping; and
                                 (ii) by fluctuations in consumption, including peak
                              consumption by quarter.
                     (c) EVALUATION OF INSTALLATIONS FOR POTENTIAL NET ZERO
Determination.      WATER USAGE.—
                            (1) EVALUATION REQUIRED.—The Secretary concerned shall
                         conduct an evaluation of each military installation under the
                         jurisdiction of the Secretary to determine the potential for
                         the military installation, or at a minimum certain installation
                         activities, to achieve net zero water usage.

								(ii) the information that should be communicated between individual modular systems (such as tracking and targeting data or command and control instructions); and								
								(III) the desired function of the communication between modular systems (such as fire control functions); and								
								(ii) a default configuration specifying which modular systems should communicate with other modular systems, including modular systems of other weapon systems;								
								(B) each relevant Department of Defense contract entered into after the date on which the regulations and guidance required under paragraph (1) are implemented includes requirements for the delivery of modular system interfaces for modular systems deemed relevant in the acquisition strategy or documentation referred to in subparagraph (A), including—								
								(i) software-defined interface syntax and properties, specifically governing how values are validly passed and received between major subsystems and components, in machine-readable format;								
								(ii) a machine-readable definition of the relationship between the delivered interface and existing common standards or interfaces available in the interface repositories established pursuant to subsection (c);								
								(iii) documentation with functional descriptions of software-defined interfaces, conveying semantic meaning of interface elements, such as the function of a given interface field;								
								(C) the relevant program offices, including those responsible for maintaining and upgrading legacy systems—								
								(i) that have not characterized the desired modularity of the systems nevertheless meet the requirements of paragraph (2)(A), if the program officers make an effort, to the extent practicable, to update the acquisition strategies required under section 2431a of title 10, United States Code, or to develop or update other relevant documentation; and								
								(ii) that have awarded contracts that do not include the requirements specified in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) nevertheless acquire, to the extent practicable, the items specified in clauses (i) through (iii) of such subparagraph, either through contractual updates, separate negotiations or contracts, or program management mechanisms; and								
								(D) the relevant program officers deliver modular system interfaces and the associated documentation to at least one of the repositories established pursuant to subsection (c).								
						(3) APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE.—								
								(A) APPLICABILITY.—The regulations and guidance required under paragraph (1) shall apply to any program office responsible for the prototyping, acquisition, or sustainment of a new or existing weapon system.

and applicability of such technology to the business systems and cybersecurity tools of the Department.
(B) COVERAGE.—The assessment required under subparagraph (A) shall include—
(i) an evaluation as how the technologies referred to in such subparagraph could be used in conjunction with or instead of existing cybersecurity standards, frameworks, and technologies designed to enable communication between, and coordination of, cybersecurity tools;
(ii) as appropriate, demonstrations by the Chief Information Office of the use of such technologies in enabling communication between, and coordination of, previously incompatible cybersecurity tools; and
(iii) as appropriate, demonstrations of the use of such technologies in enabling communication between previously incompatible business systems.
(3) SUSTAINMENT OF CERTAIN ENGINEERING RESOURCES AND
CAPABILITIES.—During the period of the demonstrations and assessments required under this subsection are conducted, and thereafter to the extent required to execute the activities directed by the Joint All-Domain Command and Control cross-functional team, the Joint All-Domain Command and Control cross-functional team shall sustain the System of Systems Technology Integration Tool Chain for Heterogeneous Electronic Systems engineering resources and capabilities developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
(4) TRANSFER OF REPSONSIBILITY.—Not earlier than 1 year before, and not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense may transfer responsibility for maintaining the engineering resources and capabilities described in paragraph (3) to a different organization within the Department.
(e) OPEN STANDARDS.—Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring, preventing, or interfering with the use or application of any given communication standard or interface. The communication described in subsection (a)(2)(A) may be accomplished by using existing open standards, by the creation and use of new open standards, or through other approaches, provided that such standards meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2)(B).
(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:
(1) The term “covered technology” means the domain-specific programming language for interface field transformations and its associated compilation toolchain (commonly known as the “System of Systems Technology Integration ToolChain for Heterogeneous Electronic Systems”) developed under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation program, or any other technology that is functionally equivalent.
(2) The term “desired modularity” means the desired degree to which weapon systems, components within a weapon system, and components across weapon systems can function as modules that can communicate across component boundaries and through interfaces and can be separated and recombined to achieve various effects, missions, or capabilities, as determined by the program officer for such weapon system.

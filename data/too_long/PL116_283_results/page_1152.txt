134 STAT. 4538            PUBLIC LAW 116–283—JAN. 1, 2021

Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, a voluntary risk management framework for trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. The framework shall—

          “(1) identify and provide standards, guidelines, best practices, methodologies, procedures and processes for—
                    “(A) developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems;
                    “(B) assessing the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence systems; and
                    “(C) mitigating risks from artificial intelligence systems;
          “(2) establish common definitions and characterizations for aspects of trustworthiness, including explainability, transparency, safety, privacy, security, robustness, fairness, bias, ethics, validation, verification, interpretability, and other properties related to artificial intelligence systems that are common across all sectors;
          “(3) provide case studies of framework implementation;
          “(4) align with international standards, as appropriate;
          “(5) incorporate voluntary consensus standards and industry best practices; and
          “(6) not prescribe or otherwise require the use of specific information or communications technology products or services.
“(d) PARTICIPATION IN STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATIONS.—
          “(1) REQUIREMENT.—The Institute shall participate in the development of standards and specifications for artificial intelligence.
          “(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this participation shall be to ensure—
                    “(A) that standards promote artificial intelligence systems that are trustworthy; and
                    “(B) that standards relating to artificial intelligence reflect the state of technology and are fit-for-purpose and developed in transparent and consensus-based processes that are open to all stakeholders.
“(e) DATA SHARING BEST PRACTICES.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director shall, in collaboration with other public and private sector organizations, develop guidance to facilitate the creation of voluntary data sharing arrangements between industry, federally funded research centers, and Federal agencies for the purpose of advancing artificial intelligence research and technologies, including options for partnership models between government entities, industry, universities, and nonprofits that incentivize each party to share the data they collected.
“(f) BEST PRACTICES FOR DOCUMENTATION OF DATA SETS.— Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director shall, in collaboration with other public and private sector organizations, develop best practices for datasets used to train artificial intelligence systems, including—
          “(1) standards for metadata that describe the properties of datasets, including—
                    “(A) the origins of the data;
                    “(B) the intent behind the creation of the data;
                    “(C) authorized uses of the data;

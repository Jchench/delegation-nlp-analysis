  "(E) MINIMUM ASSESSMENTS.—The Corporation shall
design the risk-based assessment system for any deposit
insurance fund so that, if the Corporation has borrowings
outstanding under section 14 on behalf of that fund or the
reserve ratio of that fund remains below the designated
reserve ratio, the total amount raised by semiannual assess-
ments on members of that fund shall be not less than the
total amount that would have been raised if—
    "(i) section 7(b) as in effect on July 15, 1991 remained
in effect; and
    "(ii) the assessment rate in effect on July 15, 1991
remained in effect.

ANCE FUND.—With respect to the Savings Association Insur-
ance Fund, during the period beginning on the effective

    "(i) subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall apply as if such
subparagraph did not include 'as provided in paragraph
(3)'; and
    "(ii) subparagraph (E) shall be applied by substitut-
ing 'if section 7(b) as in effect on July 15, 1991 remained
in effect.' for 'if—' and all that follows through clause
(ii).
  "(G) SPECIAL RULE UNTIL THE INSURANCE FUNDS ACHIEVE
THE DESIGNATED RESERVE RATIO.—Until a deposit insurance
fund achieves the designated reserve ratio, the Corporation
may limit the maximum assessment on insured depository
institutions under the risk-based assessment system au-
thorized under paragraph (1) to not less than 10 basis points
above the average assessment on insured depository institu-
tions under that system.
  "(3) SPECIAL RULE FOR RECAPITALIZING UNDERCAPITALIZED
FUNDS.—
    "(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2)(F),
if the reserve ratio of any deposit insurance fund is less
than the designated reserve ratio under paragraph
(2)(A)(iv), the Board of Directors shall set semiannual
assessment rates for members of that fund—
      "(i) that are sufficient to increase the reserve ratio
for that fund to the designated reserve ratio not later
than 1 year after such rates are set; or
      "(ii) in accordance with a schedule promulgated by
the Corporation under subparagraph (B).
    "(B) RECAPITALIZATION SCHEDULES.—For purposes of
subparagraph (A)(ii), the Corporation shall by regulation
promulgate a schedule that specifies, at semiannual inter-
vals, target reserve ratios for that fund, culminating in a

not later than 15 years after the date on which the schedule
is implemented.

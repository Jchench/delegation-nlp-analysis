105 STAT. 2288	                                                                             PUBLIC LAW 102-242—DEC. 19, 1991 

the United States to terminate the activities of such branch,
agency, or subsidiary if the Board finds that—
		“(A) the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive
	supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the
	appropriate authorities in its home country; or
		“(B)(i) there is reasonable cause to believe that such
	foreign bank, or any affiliate of such foreign bank, has
	committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or
	unsound banking practice in the United States; and
			  “(ii) as a result of such violation or practice, the contin-
	ued operation of the foreign bank’s branch, agency or
	commercial lending company subsidiary in the United
	States would not be consistent with the public interest or
	with the purposes of this Act, the Bank Holding Company
	Act of 1956, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
	However, in making findings under this paragraph, the Board
	shall not make size the sole determinant factor, and may take
	into account the needs of the community as well as the length of
	operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home
	country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the
	Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending
	company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United
	States pursuant to any standard set forth in this Act.
		“(2) DISCRETION TO DENY HEARING.—The Board may issue an
	order under paragraph (1) without providing for an opportunity
	for a hearing if the Board determines that expeditious action is
	necessary in order to protect the public interest.
		“(3) EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMINATION ORDER.—An order issued
	under paragraph (1) shall take effect before the end of the 120-
	day period beginning on the date such order is issued unless the
	Board extends such period.
		“(4) COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW.—Any foreign
	bank required to terminate activities conducted at offices or
	subsidiaries in the United States pursuant to this subsection
	shall comply with the requirements of applicable Federal and
	State law with respect to procedures for the closure or dissolu-
	tion of such offices or subsidiaries.
		“(5) RECOMMENDATION TO AGENCY FOR TERMINATION OF A FED-
	ERAL BRANCH OR AGENCY.—The Board may transmit to the
	Comptroller of the Currency a recommendation that the license
	of any Federal branch or Federal agency of a foreign bank be
	terminated in accordance with section 4(i) if the Board has
	reasonable cause to believe that such foreign bank or any
	affiliate of such foreign bank has engaged in conduct for which
	the activities of any State branch or agency may be terminated
	under paragraph (1).
		“(6) ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.—
			“(A) IN GENERAL.—In the case of contumacy of any office
	or subsidiary of the foreign bank against which the Board
	or, in the case of an order issued under section 4(i), the
	Comptroller of the Currency has issued an order under
	paragraph (1) or a refusal by such office or subsidiary to
	comply with such order, the Board or the Comptroller of the
	Currency may invoke the aid of the district court of the
	United States within the jurisdiction of which the office or
	subsidiary is located.

SEC. 221. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—
(1) a large number of juvenile and family courts are inundated with increasing numbers of cases due to increased reports of abuse and neglect, increasing drug-related maltreatment, and insufficient court resources;
(2) the amendments made to the Social Security Act by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 make substantial demands on the courts handling abuse and neglect cases, but provide no assistance to the courts to meet those demands;
(3) the Adoption and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires courts to—
    (A) determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to prevent foster care placement;
    (B) approve voluntary nonjudicial placement; and

(5) compliance with the Adoption and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and overall improvements in the judicial response to abuse and neglect cases can best come about through action by top level court administrators and judges with administrative functions who understand the unique aspects of decisions required in child abuse and neglect cases; and

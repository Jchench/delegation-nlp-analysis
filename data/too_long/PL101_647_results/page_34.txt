assurance that the accused will be tried in an expeditious
manner.
   (5) A victim of crime should have the right to be present at all
proceedings related to the offense against him, unless the victim
is to testify and the court determines that the victim's testi-
mony would be materially prejudiced by hearing other testi-
mony at the trial.
   (6) Victims of crime should have the right to information
about the conviction, sentencing and imprisonment of the
person who committed the crime against them.
   (7) Victims of crime should be compensated for the damage

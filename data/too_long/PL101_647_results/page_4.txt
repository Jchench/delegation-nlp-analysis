                             SEC. 211. FINDINGS.
42 USC 13001. The Congress finds that—
      (1) over 2,000,000 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect 
      are made each year, and drug abuse is associated with a signifi-
      cant portion of these;
      (2) the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases is
      extremely complex, involving numerous agencies and dozens of
      personnel;
      (3) in such cases, too often the system does not pay sufficient
      attention to the needs and welfare of the child victim, aggravat-
      ing the trauma that the child victim has already experienced;
      (4) multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecu-
      tion programs have been developed that increase the reporting
      of child abuse cases, reduce the trauma to the child victim, and
      increase the successful prosecution of child abuse offenders; and 
      (5) such programs have proven effective, and with targeted
      Federal assistance, could be duplicated in many jurisdictions
      throughout the country.

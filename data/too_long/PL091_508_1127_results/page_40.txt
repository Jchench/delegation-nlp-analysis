proof of identity for purposes of sec­ tions 605A, 605B, and 609(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In devel­oping these requirements, the con­ sumer reporting agencies must:
(1) Ensure that the information is sufficient to enable the consumer re­porting agency to match consumers with their files; and
(2) Adjust the information to be com­mensurate with an identifiable risk of harm arising from misidentifying the consumer.
(b) Examples of information that might constitute reasonable informa­tion requirements for proof of identity are provided for illustrative purposes only, as follows:
(1) Consumer file match: The identi­fication information of the consumer including his or her full name (first, middle initial, last, suffix), any other or previously used names, current and/ or recent full address (street number and name, apt. no., city, state, and zip code), full 9 digits of Social Security number, and/or date of birth.
(2) Additional proof of identity: cop­ies of government issued identifica­tion documents, utility bills, and/ or other methods of authentication of a person's identity which the con­sumer must be notified to, answering questions to which only the consumer might be expected to know the answer.

(i) Uses a consumer report in connec­tion with an application for, or a grant,
extension, or other provision of, credit to a consumer that is primarily for per­sonal, family, or household purposes; and

(2) Business credit excluded. This part does not apply to an application for, or a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit to a consumer or to any other applicant primarily for a business pur­pose.

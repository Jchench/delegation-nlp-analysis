§ 610.2                                                                                          16 CFR Ch. I (1–1–11 Edition)

agency experiences high request volume, if the nationwide consumer reporting agency:
    (i) Collects all consumer request information and delays accepting the request for processing until a reasonable later time; and 
    (ii) Clearly and prominently informs the consumer of when the request will be accepted for processing.
(2) Extraordinary request volume. Provided that the nationwide consumer reporting agency has implemented reasonable procedures developed in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section, entitled “requirement to anticipate”, the nationwide consumer reporting agency shall not be deemed in violation of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for any period of time during which a particular centralized source request method, the centralized source, or the nationwide consumer reporting agency experiences extraordinary request volume.
(f) Information use and disclosure. Any personally identifiable information collected from consumers as a result of a request for annual file disclosure, or other disclosure required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, made through the centralized source, may be used or disclosed by the centralized source or a nationwide consumer reporting agency only:
    (1) To provide the annual file disclosure or other disclosure required under the FCRA requested by the consumer;
    (2) To process a transaction requested by the consumer at the same time as a request for annual file disclosure or other disclosure;
    (3) To comply with applicable legal requirements, including those imposed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and this part; and

    (i) In the case of requests made by mail or telephone, the consumer “has obtained his or her annual file disclosure” when the file disclosure is mailed, and the nationwide consumer reporting agency may include advertising for other products or services with the file disclosure.
    (ii) In the case of requests made through the centralized source Internet website, the consumer “has obtained his or her annual file disclosure” when the file disclosure is delivered to the consumer through the Internet, and the nationwide consumer reporting agency may include advertising for other products or services with the file disclosure.
(2) Any communications, instructions, or permitted advertising or marketing shall not interfere with, detract from, contradict, or otherwise undermine the purpose of the centralized source stated in paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) Examples of interfering, detracting, inconsistent, and or undermining communications include:
    (i) Centralized source materials that represent, expressly or by implication, that a consumer must purchase a paid product or service in order to receive or to understand the annual file disclosure;
    (ii) Centralized source materials that represent, expressly or by implication, that annual file disclosures are not free, or that obtaining an annual file disclosure will have a negative impact on the consumers’ credit standing; and
    (iii) Centralized source materials that falsely represent, expressly or by implication, that a product or service offered ancillary to receipt of a file disclosure, such as a credit score or credit monitoring service, is free, or fail to clearly and prominently disclose that consumers must cancel a service, advertised as free for an initial period of

§ 610.2

(D) A statement indicating that the
consumer has reached the website or
telephone number for ordering free annual credit reports as required by federal law; and
(3) Make available to consumers a
standardized form established jointly
by the nationwide consumer reporting
agencies, which consumers may use to
make a request for an annual file disclosure, either by mail or on the Internet website required under § 610.2(b)(1)
of this part, from the centralized
source required by this part. The form
provided at 16 CFR Part 698, Appendix
D, may be used to comply with this
section.
(c) Requirement to anticipate. The nationwide consumer reporting agencies
shall implement reasonable procedures
to anticipate, and to respond to, the
volume of consumers who will contact
the centralized source through each request method, to request, or attempt
to request, a file disclosure, including
developing and implementing contingency plans to address circumstances
that are reasonably likely to occur and
that may materially and adversely impact the operation of the nationwide
consumer reporting agency, a centralized source request method, or the centralized source.
(1) The contingency plans required by
this section shall include reasonable
measures to minimize the impact of
such circumstances on the operation of
the centralized source and on consumers contacting, or attempting to
contact, the centralized source.
(i) Such reasonable measures to minimize impact shall include, but are not
necessarily limited to:
(A) The extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, providing information to consumers on
how to use another available request
method;
(B) The extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, communicating, to a consumer who attempts but is unable to make a request, the fact that a condition exists
that has precluded the centralized
source from accepting all requests, and
the period of time after which the centralized source is reasonably anticipated to be able to accept the consumers’ request for an annual file disclosure; and
(C) Taking all reasonable steps to restore the centralized source to normal
operating status as quickly as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
(ii) Reasonable measures to minimize
impact may also include, as appropriate, collecting request information
but declining to accept the request for
processing until a reasonable later
time, provided that the consumer is
clearly and prominently informed, to
the extent reasonably practicable
under the circumstances, of when the
request will be accepted for processing.
(2) A nationwide consumer reporting
agency shall not be deemed in violation of § 610.2(b)(2)(i) of this part if a
centralized source request method is
unavailable to accept requests for a
reasonable period of time for purposes
of conducting maintenance on the request method, provided that the other
required request methods remain available during such time.
(d) Disclosures required. If a nationwide consumer reporting agency has
the ability to provide a consumer report to a third party relating to a consumer, regardless of whether the consumer report is owned by that nationwide consumer reporting agency or by
an associated consumer reporting agency, that nationwide consumer reporting agency shall, upon proper identification in compliance with section
610(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681h(a)(1), provide an
annual file disclosure to such consumer
if the consumer makes a request
through the centralized source.
(e) High request volume and extraordinary request volume—(1) High request
volume. Provided that a nationwide
consumer reporting agency has implemented reasonable procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (c)
of this section, entitled ‘‘requirement
to anticipate’’, the nationwide consumer reporting agency shall not be
deemed in violation of paragraph
(b)(2)(i) of this section for any period of
time in which a centralized source request method, the centralized source,
or the nationwide consumer reporting

APPENDIX E TO PART 698—SUMMARY OF 
     CONSUMER IDENTITY THEFT RIGHTS

The prescribed form for this summary is a 
disclosure that is substantially similar to 
the Commission’s model summary with all
information clearly and prominently dis-
played. A summary should accurately reflect
changes to those items that may change over
time (such as telephone numbers) to remain
in compliance. Translations of this summary
will be in compliance with the Commission’s
prescribed model, provided that the trans-
lation is accurate and that it is provided in
a language used by the recipient consumer.

§ 610.3                                                            16 CFR Ch. 1 (1–1–11 Edition)

contact the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency through the streamlined process to request, or attempt to request, file disclosures, including developing and implementing contingency plans to address circumstances that are reasonably likely to occur and that may materially and adversely impact the operation of the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency, a request method, or the streamlined process. 
  (1) The contingency plans required by this section shall include reasonable measures to minimize the impact of such circumstances on the operation of the streamlined process and on consumers contacting, or attempting to contact, the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency through the streamlined process. 
    (i) Such reasonable measures to minimize impact shall include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
      (A) To the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, providing information to consumers on how to use another available request method; 
      (B) To the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, communicating to a consumer who attempts but is unable to make a request, the fact that a condition exists that has reduced the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency from accepting all requests, and the period of time after which the agency is reasonably anticipated to be able to accept the consumer’s request for an annual file disclosure; and 
      (C) Taking all reasonable steps to restore the streamlined process to normal operating status as quickly as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
    (ii) Measures to minimize impact also include, as appropriate, collecting request information but declining to accept the request for processing until a reasonable later time, provided that the consumer is clearly and prominently informed, to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, of when the request will be accepted for processing.
  (2) A nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency shall not be deemed in violation of section 610.3(a)(2)(i) if 

the toll-free telephone number required by this part is unavailable to accept requests for a reasonable period of time for purposes of conducting maintenance on the request method, provided that the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency makes other request methods available to consumers during such time.
  (c) High request volume and extraordinary request volume—(1) High request volume. Provided that the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency has implemented reasonable procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, entitled “requirement to anticipate,” a nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency shall not be deemed in violation of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for any period of time during which a streamlined process request method for the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency experiences high request volume, if the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency:
    (i) Collects all consumer request information and delays accepting the request for processing until a reasonable later time; and
    (ii) Clearly and prominently informs the consumer of when the request will be accepted for processing.
  (2) Extraordinary request volume. Provided that the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency has implemented reasonable procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, entitled “requirement to anticipate,” a nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency shall not be deemed in violation of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for any period of time during which a streamlined process request method of the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency experiences extraordinary request volume, if:
    (i) Information use and disclosure. Any personally identifiable information collected from consumers as a result of a request for annual file disclosure, or any other disclosure required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, made through the streamlined process, may be used or disclosed by the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency only:
                                                                                                        580

(iii) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or serv- ice offered by that person during the three-month period immediately pre- ceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this part.
(2) Examples of pre-existing business re- lationships. (i) If a consumer has an ex- isting loan account with a creditor, the creditor has a pre-existing business re- lationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicita- tions to the consumer about its products or services.
(ii) If a consumer obtained a mort- gage from a mortgage lender, but refinanced the mortgage loan with a dif- ferent lender when the mortgage loan came due, the first mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligi- bility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or serv- ices for 18 months after the date the outstanding balance of the loan is paid and the loan is closed.
(iii) If a consumer obtains a mort- gage, the mortgage lender has a pre-ex- isting business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender sells the consumer's entire loan to an inves- tor, the mortgage lender has a pre-ex- isting business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility infor- mation it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date it sells the loan, and the investor has a pre-existing business relationship with the con- sumer upon purchasing the loan. If, however, the mortgage lender sells a fractional interest in the consumer's loan to an investor but also retains an ownership interest in the loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer, but the investor does not have a pre-existing business rela- tionship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender retains ownership of the loan, but sells ownership of the servicing rights to the consumer's loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business rela- tionship with the consumer. The purchaser of the servicing rights also has a pre- existing business relationship with the consumer as of the date it purchases ownership of the servicing rights, but only if it collects payments from or otherwise deals directly with the con- sumer on a continuing basis.
(iv) If a consumer applies to a cred- itor for a product or service that it of- fers, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the cred- itor, the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the con- sumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affil- iate to make solicitations to the con- sumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the application.
(v) If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a creditor about its products or services and provides contact infor- mation to the creditor, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the creditor, the cred- itor has a pre-existing business rela- tionship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make so- licitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.
(vi) If a consumer makes an inquiry to a creditor by e-mail about its prod- ucts or services, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the creditor, the creditor has a pre-ex- isting business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligi- bility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or serv- ices for three months after the date of the inquiry.
(vii) If a consumer has an existing re- lationship with a creditor that is part of a group of affiliated companies, makes a telephone call to the central- ized call center for the group of affili- ated companies to inquire about products or services offered by an insur- ance affiliate, and provides contact in- formation to the call center, the call constitutes an inquiry to the insurance affiliate that offers those products or services. The insurance affiliate has a

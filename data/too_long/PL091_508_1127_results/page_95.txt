APPENDIX D TO PART 698—STANDARDIZED FORM FOR REQUESTING ANNUAL FILE DISCLOSURES.

REQUEST FOR FREE CREDIT REPORT

Note to Consumers: You have the right to obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months (also known as an "annual file disclosure"), from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. Your report may contain information on where you work and live, the credit accounts that have been opened in your name, if you've paid your bills on time, and whether you have been sued, arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. Businesses use this information in making decisions about whether to offer you credit, insurance, or employment, and on what terms.

Use this form to request your credit report from any, or all, of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies.

The following information is required to process your request:

Your Full Name: _______________________________________________________________

Your Street Address: ___________________________________________________________

Your City, State & Zip Code: _____________________________________________________

Your Telephone Numbers (with area code): Day: __________________________________
                   Evening: _____________________________________

Your Social Security number: ______________ Your Date of Birth_______________

Place a check next to each credit report you want.

_____ I want a credit report from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies

OR

_____ I want a credit report from:
_____ [name of nationwide consumer reporting agency]
_____ [name of nationwide consumer reporting agency]
_____ [name of nationwide consumer reporting agency]

Please check how you would like to receive your report. (Note: because of the need to accurately identify you before we send you your credit report, we may not be able to offer every delivery method to every consumer. We will try to honor your preference.)

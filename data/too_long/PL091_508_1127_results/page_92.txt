Credit Scores and the Price You Pay for Credit

Your Credit Score

Your credit score

Your credit score is not available from [Insert name of CRA], which is a consumer reporting agency, because they may not have enough information about your credit history to calculate a score.

What you should know about credit scores

A credit score is a number that reflects the information in a credit report.

A credit report is a record of your credit history. It includes information about whether you pay your bills on time and how much you owe to creditors.

A credit score can change, depending on how a consumer's credit history changes.

Why credit scores are important

Credit scores are important because consumers who have higher credit scores generally will get more favorable credit terms.

Not having a credit score can affect whether you can get a loan and how much you will have to pay for that loan.

Checking Your Credit Report

What if there are mistakes in your credit report?

You have a right to dispute any inaccurate information in your credit report. If you find mistakes on your credit report, contact the consumer reporting agency.

It is a good idea to check your credit report to make sure the information it contains is accurate.

How can you obtain a copy of your credit report?

Under federal law, you have the right to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies once a year.

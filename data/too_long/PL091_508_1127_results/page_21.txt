Pt. 600, App. 16 CFR Ch. I (1–1–11 Edition)

for the telephone call is prepaid by or charged directly to the consumer.
(c) Any consumer reporting agency shall provide trained personnel to explain to the consumer any information furnished to him pursuant to section 609.
(d) The consumer shall be permitted to be accompanied by one other person of his choosing, who shall furnish reasonable identification. A consumer reporting agency may require the consumer to furnish a written statement granting permission to the consumer reporting agency to discuss the consumer’s file in such person’s presence.
(e) Except as provided in section 616 and 617, no consumer may bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation, invasion of privacy, or negligence with respect to the reporting of information against any consumer reporting agency, any user of information or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency, based on information disclosed pursuant to section 609, 610, or 615, except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.

1. Time of Disclosure
A consumer reporting agency must make disclosures during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. However, the consumer reporting agency may waive reasonable notice, and the consumer may agree to disclosure outside of normal business hours. A consumer reporting agency may make in-person disclosure to consumers who have made appointments ahead of other consumers, because the disclosures are only required to be made “on reasonable notice.”

2. Extra Conditions Prohibited
A consumer reporting agency may not add conditions not set out in the FCRA as a prerequisite to the required disclosure.

3. Manner of Disclosure
A consumer reporting agency may, with the consumer's oral or implied consent, meet its disclosure obligations by mail, in lieu of the in-person or telephone disclosures specified in the statute.

4. Disclosure in the Presence of Third Parties
When the consumer requests disclosure in a third party's presence, the consumer reporting agency may require that a consumer sign and dating authorization before such disclosure is made. The consumer may choose the third party to accompany him or her for the disclosure.

5. Expense of Telephone Calls
A consumer reporting agency is not required to pay the telephone charge for a telephone interview with a consumer obtaining disclosure.

6. Qualified Defamation Privilege
The privilege extended by subsection 610(e) does not apply to

                                      FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

SEC. 2. (a) The Congress finds that-
               (1) annual losses throughout the Nation from floods and mud- 
    slides are increasing at an alarming rate, largely as a result of 
    the accelerating development of, and concentration of population 
    in areas of flood and mudslide hazards; 
               (2) the availability of Federal loans, grants, guaranties,  
    insurance, and other forms of financial assistance are often 
    determining factors in the utilization of land and the location 
    and construction of public and of private industrial, commercial, 
    and residential facilities;
               (3) property acquired or constructed with grants or other 
    Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods, 
    thus frustrating the purpose for which such assistance was 
    extended;
               (4) Federal instrumentalities insure or otherwise provide  
    financial protection to banking and credit institutions whose assets 
    include a substantial number of mortgage loans and other indebt-
    edness secured by property exposed to loss and damage from 
    floods and mudslides;
(5) the Nation cannot afford the tragic losses of life caused annually by flood occurrences, nor the increasing losses of property suffered by flood victims, most of whom are still inadequately compensated despite the provision of costly disaster relief benefits: and
(6) it is in the public interest for persons already living in flood-prone areas to have both an opportunity to purchase flood insurance and access to more adequate limits of coverage. so that they will be indemnified for their losses in the event of future flood disasters.
(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to—
(1) substantially increase the limits of coverage authorized under the national flood insurance program;
(2) provide for the expeditious identification of, and the dissemination of information concerning, flood-prone areas;
(3) require States or local communities, as a condition of future Federal financial assistance, to participate in the flood insurance program and to adopt adequate flood plain ordinances with effective enforcement provisions consistent with Federal standards to reduce or avoid future flood losses; and
(4) require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by federally supervised, regulated, or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land or facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards.

Whether or not the community decides to appeal the Secretary's determination, copies of individual appeals shall be sent to the Secretary as they are received by the community, and the community's appeal or a copy of its decision not to appeal shall be filed with the Secretary not later than ninety days after the date of the second newspaper publication of the Secretary's notification.

(d) In the event the Secretary does not receive an appeal from the community within the ninety days provided, he shall consolidate and review on their own merits, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (e), the appeals filed within the community by private persons and shall make such modifications of his proposed determinations as may be appropriate, taking into account the written opinion, if any, issued by the community in not supporting such appeals.

The Secretary shall make his determination within a reasonable time. The community shall be given a reasonable time after the Secretary's final determination in which to adopt local land use and control measures consistent with the Secretary's determination. The reports and other information used by the Secretary in making his final determination shall be made available for public inspection and shall be admissible, in a court of law in the event the community seeks judicial review as provided by this section.

TITLE II-DISASTER MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS

NOTIFICATION TO FLOOD-PRONE AREAS

Sec. 201. (a) Not later than six months following the enactment of this title, the Secretary shall publish information in accordance with subsection 1360 (1) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, and
shall notify the chief executive officer of each known flood-prone com-
munity not already participating in the national flood insurance pro-
gram of its tentative identification as a community containing one
or more areas having special flood hazards.

(b) After such notification, each tentatively identified community
shall either (1) promptly make proper application to participate in
the national flood insurance program or (2) within six months submit
technical data sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary
that the community either is not seriously flood prone or that such flood
hazards as may have existed have been corrected by floodworks or
other flood control methods. The Secretary may, in his discretion,
grant a public hearing to any community with respect to which con-
flicting data exist as to the nature and extent of a flood hazard. If
the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the community shall be
given an opportunity to submit written and documentary evidence.
Whether or not such hearing is granted, the Secretary's final deter-
mination as to the existence or extent of a flood hazard area in a par-
ticular community shall be deemed conclusive for the purposes of this
Act if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as
a whole.

(c) As information becomes available to the Secretary concerning
the existence of flood hazards in communities not known to be flood
prone at the time of the initial notification provided for by subsection
(a) of this section he shall provide similar notifications to the chief
executive officers of such additional communities, which shall then be
subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

(d) Formally identified flood-prone communities that do not qualify
for the national flood insurance program within one year after such
notification or by the date specified in section 202, whichever is later,
shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of that section relating to
flood-prone communities which are not participating in the program.

area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance
program.

(b) Each Federal instrumentality responsible for the supervision,
approval, regulation, or insuring of banks, savings and loan associa-
tions, or similar institutions shall by regulation prohibit such institu-
tions on and after July 1, 1975, from making, increasing, extending,
or renewing any loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home
located or to be located in an area that has been identified by the
Secretary as an area having special flood hazards, unless the com-
munity in which such area is situated is then participating in the
national flood insurance program.
